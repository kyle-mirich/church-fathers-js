I have reluctantly adopted the\nopinion that his Epistle was written near the close of his life, and not\njust after the persecution of Nero. It is not improbable that Linus and\nCletus both perished in that fiery trial, and that Clement’s\nimmediate succession to their work and place occasions the chronological\ndifficulties of the period. After the death of the apostles, for the\nRoman imprisonment and martyrdom of St. Peter seem historical, Clement\nwas the natural representative of St. Paul, and even of his companion,\nthe “apostle of the circumcision;” and naturally he wrote the\nEpistle in the name of the local church, when brethren looked to them for\nadvice. St. John, no doubt, was still surviving at Patmos or in Ephesus;\nbut the Philippians, whose intercourse with Rome is attested by the visit\nof Epaphroditus, looked naturally to the surviving friends of their great\nfounder; nor was the aged apostle in the East equally accessible.

It is clear from the writing itself that it was\ncomposed soon after some persecution (chap. i.) which the Roman Church\nhad endured; and the only question is, whether we are to fix upon the\npersecution under Nero or Domitian. If the former, the date will be about\nthe year 68; if the latter, we must place it towards the close of the\nfirst century or the beginning of the second. We possess no external aid\nto the settlement of this question. The lists of early Roman bishops are\nin hopeless confusion, some making Clement the immediate successor of St.\nPeter, others placing Linus, and others still Linus and Anacletus,\nbetween him and the apostle. The internal evidence, again, leaves the\nmatter doubtful, though it has been strongly pressed on both sides. The\nprobability seems, on the whole, to be in favour of the Domitian period,\nso that the Epistle may be dated about \u003cspan class=\"sc\" id=\"ii.i-p8.1\"\u003ea.d.\u003c/span\u003e 97. 97.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ii.i-p9\"\u003eThis Epistle was held in very great esteem by the early\nChurch.

He\nbears our iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed\nthat [on His own account] He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and\naffliction. But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for\nour iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His\nstripes we were healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man\nhas wandered in his own way; and the Lord has delivered Him up for our\nsins, while He in the midst of His sufferings openeth not His mouth. He\nwas brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer\nis dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was\ntaken away; who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from\nthe earth. For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to\ndeath.

And when the time of its dissolution draws near that\nit must die, it builds itself a nest of frankincense, and myrrh, and\nother spices, into which, when the time is fulfilled, it enters and dies.\nBut as the flesh decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being\nnourished by the juices of the dead bird, brings forth feathers. Then,\nwhen it has acquired strength, it takes up that nest in which are the\nbones of its parent, and bearing these it passes from the land of Arabia\ninto Egypt, to the city called Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying in\nthe sight of all men, it places them on the altar of the sun, and having\ndone this, hastens back to its former abode. The priests then inspect the\nregisters of the dates, and find that it has returned exactly as the five\nhundredth year was completed.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"104\"\u003e104\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
