It was more than a hundred\nyears since the angels had sung “Good-will to men;” and that\nsong had now been heard for successive generations, breaking forth from\nthe lips of sufferers on the cross, among lions, and amid blazing\nfaggots. Here was a nobler Stoicism that needed interpretation. Not only\nchoice spirits, despising the herd and boasting of a loftier intellectual\nsphere, were its professors; but thousands of men, women, and children,\nwithdrawing themselves not at all from the ordinary and humble lot of the\npeople, were inspired by it to live and die heroically and sublimely,\n—exhibiting a superiority to revenge and hate entirely\nunaccountable, praying for their enemies, and seeking to glorify their\nGod by love to their fellow-men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.i-p3\"\u003eAnd in spite of Gallios and Neros alike, the gospel was\ndispelling the gross darkness. Of this, Pliny’s letter to Trajan is\ndecisive evidence. Even in Seneca we detect reflections of the daybreak.\nPlutarch writes as never a Gentile could have written until now. Plato is\npractically surpassed by him in his thoughts upon the “delays\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1765\"\u003e1765\u003c/sup\u003e of the Divine Justice.”\nHadrian’s address to his soul, in his dying moments, is a tribute\nto the new ideas which had been sown in the popular mind. And now the\nAntonines, impelled by something in the age, came forward to reign as\n“philosophers.” At this moment, Justin Martyr confronts them\nlike a Daniel. The “little stone” smites the imperial image\nin the face, not yet “in the toes.” He tells the professional\nphilosophers on a throne how false and hollow is all wisdom that is not\nmeant for all humanity, and that is not capable of leavening the masses.\nHe exposes the impotency of even Socratic philosophy: he shows, in\ncontrast, the force that works in the words of Jesus; he points out their\nregenerating power. It is the mission of Justin to be a star in the West,\nleading its Wise Men to the cradle of Bethlehem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.i-p5\"\u003e\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_160.html\" id=\"viii.i-Page_160\" n=\"160\" /\u003e\n\nThe writings of Justin are deficient in\ncharms of style; and, for us, there is something the reverse of\nattractive in the forms of thought which he had learned from the\nphilosophers.\n\nThe writings of Justin are deficient in\ncharms of style; and, for us, there is something the reverse of\nattractive in the forms of thought which he had learned from the\nphilosophers.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1766\"\u003e1766\u003c/sup\u003e If Plato had left us nothing\nbut the Timæus, a Renan would doubtless have reproached him as of feeble\nintellectual power. So a dancing-master might criticise the movements of\nan athlete, or the writhings of St. Sebastian shot with arrows. The\npractical wisdom of Justin using the rhetoric of his times, and\ndiscomfiting false philosophy with its own weapons, is not appreciated by\nthe fastidious Parisian. But the manly and heroic pleadings of the man,\nfor a despised people with whom he had boldly identified himself; the\nintrepidity with which he defends them before despots, whose mere caprice\nmight punish him with death; above all, the undaunted spirit with which\nhe exposes the shame and absurdity of their inveterate superstition and\nreproaches the memory of Hadrian whom Antoninus had deified, as he had\ndeified Antinous of loathsome history,—these are characteristics\nwhich every instinct of the unvitiated soul delights to honour.

There is little clue to dates. It is agreed on all\nhands that he lived in the reign of Antoninus Pius, and the testimony of\nEusebius and most credible historians renders it nearly certain that he\nsuffered martyrdom in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.

He was not\nthe first that wrote an Apology in behalf of the Christians, but his\nApologies are the earliest extant. They are characterized by intense\nChristian fervour, and they give us an insight into the relations\nexisting between heathens and Christians in those days. His other\nprincipal writing, the Dialogue with Trypho, is the first elaborate\nexposition of the reasons for regarding Christ as the Messiah of the Old\nTestament, and the first systematic attempt to exhibit the false position\nof the Jews in regard to Christianity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.i-p13\"\u003eMany of Justin’s writings have perished. Those\nworks which have come to us bearing his name have been divided into three\nclasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.i-p14\"\u003e\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_161.html\" id=\"viii.i-Page_161\" n=\"161\" /\u003e\n\nThe first class embraces those which are\nunquestionably genuine, viz. the two Apologies, and the Dialogue with\nTrypho. Some critics have urged objections against Justin’s\nauthorship of the Dialogue; but the objections are regarded now as\npossessing no weight.\n\nThe first class embraces those which are\nunquestionably genuine, viz. the two Apologies, and the Dialogue with\nTrypho.

An Address to the Greeks; 2. A Hortatory Address to the\nGreeks; 3. On the Sole Government of God; 4. An Epistle to Diognetus; 5.\nFragments from a work on the Resurrection; 6. And other Fragments.\nWhatever difficulty there may be in settling the authorship of these\ntreatises, there is but one opinion as to their earliness. The latest of\nthem, in all probability, was not written later than the third\ncentury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.i-p16\"\u003eThe third class consists of those that are\nunquestionably not the works of Justin. These are: 1. An Exposition of\nthe True Faith; 2. Replies to the Orthodox; 3. Christian Questions to\nGentiles; 4. Gentile Questions to Christians; 5. Epistle to Zenas and\nSerenus; and 6. A Refutation of certain Doctrines of Aristotle. There is\nno clue to the date of the two last. There can be no doubt that the\nothers were written after the Council of Nicæa, though, immediately\nafter the Reformation, Calvin and others appealed to the first as a\ngenuine writing of Justin’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.i-p17\"\u003eThere is a curious question connected with the\nApologies of Justin which have come down to us. Eusebius mentions two\nApologies,—one written in the reign of Antoninus Pius, the other\nin the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Critics have disputed much whether we\nhave these two Apologies in those now extant. Some have maintained, that\nwhat is now called the Second Apology was the preface of the first, and\nthat the second is lost. Others have tried to show, that the so-called\nSecond Apology is the continuation of the first, and that the second is\nlost. Others have supposed that the two Apologies which we have are\nJustin’s two Apologies, but that Eusebius was wrong in affirming\nthat the second was addressed to Marcus Aurelius; and others maintain,\nthat we have in our two Apologies the two Apologies mentioned by\nEusebius, and that our first is his first, and our second his second.\u003c/p\u003e",

For if all men knew this, no one would choose\nwickedness even for a little, knowing that he goes to the everlasting\npunishment of fire; but would by all means restrain himself, and adorn\nhimself with virtue, that he might obtain the good gifts of God, and\nescape the punishments. For those who, on account of the laws and\npunishments you impose, endeavour to escape detection when they offend\n(and they offend, too, under the impression that it is quite possible to\nescape your detection, since you are but men), those persons, if they\nlearned and were convinced that nothing, whether actually done or only\nintended, can escape the knowledge of God, would by all means live\ndecently on account of the penalties threatened, as even you yourselves\nwill admit. But you seem to fear lest all men become righteous, and you\nno longer have any to punish. Such would be the concern of public\nexecutioners, but not of good princes. But, as we before said, we are\npersuaded that these things are prompted by evil spirits, who demand\nsacrifices and service even from those who live unreasonably; but as for\nyou, we presume that you who aim at [a reputation for] piety and\nphilosophy will do nothing unreasonable. But if you also, like the foolish, prefer custom\nto truth, do what you have power to do. But just so much power have\nrulers who esteem opinion more than truth, as robbers have in a desert.\nAnd that you will not succeed is\ndeclared by the Word, than whom, after God who begat Him, we know there\nis no ruler more kingly and just. For as all shrink from succeeding to\nthe poverty or sufferings or obscurity of their fathers, so whatever the\nWord forbids us to choose, the sensible man will not choose. That all these things\nshould come to pass, I say, our Teacher foretold, He who is both Son and\nApostle of God the Father of all and the Ruler, Jesus Christ; from whom\nalso we have the name of Christians. Whence we become more assured of all\nthe things He taught us, since whatever He beforehand foretold should\ncome to pass, is seen in fact coming to pass; and this is the work of\nGod, to tell of a thing before it happens, and as it was foretold so to\nshow it happening. It were possible to pause here and add no more,\nreckoning that we demand what is just and true; but because we are well\naware that it is not easy suddenly to change a mind possessed by\nignorance, we intend to add a few things, for the sake of persuading\nthose who love the truth, knowing that it is not impossible to put\nignorance to flight by presenting the truth.\u003c/p\u003e",

For let this now\nbe said hypothetically: if you yourselves were not such as you now are,\nand born of such parents [and causes], and one were to show you human\nseed and a picture of a man, and were to say with confidence that from\nsuch a substance such a being could be produced, would you believe before\nyou saw the actual production?

And when Ptolemy king of Egypt formed a library, and\nendeavoured to collect the writings of all men, he heard also of these\nprophets, and sent to Herod, who was at that time king of the Jews,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1826\"\u003e1826\u003c/sup\u003e requesting that the books of\nthe prophets be sent to him.

And when this was done, the books remained with the Egyptians,\nwhere they are until now. They are also in the possession of all Jews\nthroughout the world; but they, though they read, do not understand what\nis said, but count us foes and enemies; and, like yourselves, they kill\nand punish us whenever they have the power, as you can well believe. For\nin the Jewish war which lately raged, Barchochebas, the leader of the\nrevolt of the Jews, gave orders that Christians alone should be led to\ncruel punishments, unless they would deny Jesus Christ and utter\nblasphemy. In these books, then, of the prophets we found\nJesus our Christ foretold as coming, born of a virgin, growing up to\nman’s estate, and healing every disease and every sickness, and\nraising the dead, and being hated, and unrecognised, and crucified, and\ndying, and rising again, and ascending into heaven, and being, and being\ncalled, the Son of God. We find it also predicted that certain persons\nshould be sent by Him into every nation to publish these things, and that\nrather among the Gentiles [than among the Jews] men should believe on\nHim. And He was predicted before He appeared, first 5000 years before,\nand again 3000, then 2000, then 1000, and yet again 800; for in the\nsuccession of generations prophets after prophets arose.\u003c/p\u003e",

Up to the time of Jesus Christ, who taught us, and\ninterpreted the prophecies which were not yet understood, [they had a\nlawgiver] as was foretold by the holy and divine Spirit of prophecy\nthrough Moses, “that a ruler would not fail the Jews until He\nshould come for whom the kingdom was reserved” (for Judah was the\nforefather of the Jews, from whom also they have their name of Jews); and\nafter He (i.e., Christ) appeared, you began to rule the Jews, and gained\npossession of all their territory. And the prophecy, “He shall be\nthe expectation of the nations,” signified that there would be some\nof all nations who should look for Him to come again. And this indeed you\ncan see for yourselves, and be convinced of by fact. For of all races of\nmen there are some who look for Him who was crucified in Judæa, and\nafter whose crucifixion the land was straightway surrendered to you as\nspoil of war. And the prophecy, “binding His foal to the vine, and\nwashing His robe in the blood of the grape,” was a significant\nsymbol of the things that were to happen to Christ, and of what He was to\ndo. For the foal of an ass stood bound to a vine at the entrance of a\nvillage, and He ordered His acquaintances to bring it to Him then; and\nwhen it was brought, He mounted and sat upon it, and entered Jerusalem,\nwhere was the vast temple of the Jews which was afterwards destroyed by\nyou. And after this He was crucified, that the rest of the prophecy might\nbe fulfilled. For\nthis “washing His robe in the blood of the grape” was\npredictive of the passion He was to endure, cleansing by His blood those\nwho believe on Him.

Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor\nsinners in the council of the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of\nthe righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish. Why do the\nheathen rage, and the people imagine new things?

He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at\nthem, and the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak to\nthem in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I been\nset by Him a King on Zion His holy hill, declaring the decree of the\nLord. The Lord said to Me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten\nThee. Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance,\nand the uttermost parts of the earth as Thy possession. Thou shall herd\nthem with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shalt Thou dash them\nin pieces. Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, all ye\njudges of the earth.

We have learned\nfrom the prophets, and we hold it to be true, that punishments, and\nchastisements, and good rewards, are rendered according to the merit of\neach man’s actions. Since if it be not so, but all things happen by\nfate, neither is anything at all in our own power.

And again, unless the human race\nhave the power of avoiding evil and choosing good by free choice, they\nare not accountable for their actions, of whatever kind they be. But that\nit is by free choice they both walk uprightly and stumble, we thus\ndemonstrate. We see the same man making a transition to opposite things.\nNow, if it had been fated that he were to be either good or bad, he could\nnever have been capable of both the opposites, nor of so many\ntransitions. But not even would some be good and others bad, since we\nthus make fate the cause of evil, and exhibit her as acting in opposition\nto herself; or that which has been already stated would seem to be true,\nthat neither virtue nor vice is anything, but that things are only\nreckoned good or evil by opinion; which, as the true word shows, is the\ngreatest impiety and wickedness. But this we assert is inevitable fate,\nthat they who choose the good have worthy rewards, and they who choose\nthe opposite have their merited awards.

For having heard it\nproclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come, and that the\nungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they put forward many to\nbe called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they would be able\nto produce in men the idea that the things which were said with regard to\nChrist were mere marvellous tales, like the things which were said by the\npoets. And these things were said both among the Greeks and among all\nnations where they [the demons] heard the prophets foretelling that\nChrist would specially be believed in; but that in hearing what was said\nby the prophets they did not accurately understand it, but imitated what\nwas said of our Christ, like men who are in error, we will make plain.\nThe prophet Moses, then, was, as we have already said, older than all\nwriters; and by him, as we have also said before, it was thus predicted:\n“There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a lawgiver from\nbetween his feet, until He come for whom it is reserved; and He shall be\nthe desire of the Gentiles, binding His foal to the vine, washing His\nrobe in the blood of the grape.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1882\"\u003e1882\u003c/sup\u003e The\ndevils, accordingly, when they heard these prophetic words, said that\nBacchus was the son of Jupiter, and gave out that he was the discoverer\nof the vine, and they number wine\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1883\"\u003e1883\u003c/sup\u003e\n[or, the ass] among his mysteries; and they taught that, having been torn\nin pieces, he ascended into heaven. And because in the prophecy of Moses\nit had not been expressly intimated whether He who was to come was the\nSon of God, and whether He would, riding on the foal, remain on earth or\nascend into heaven, and because the name of “foal” could mean\neither the foal of an ass or the foal of a horse, they, not knowing\nwhether He who was foretold would bring the foal of an ass or of a horse\nas the sign of His coming, nor whether He was the Son of God, as we said\nabove, or of man, gave out that Bellerophon, a man born of man, himself\nascended to heaven on his horse Pegasus. And when they heard it said by\nthe other prophet Isaiah, that He should be born of a virgin, and by His\nown means ascend into heaven, they pretended that Perseus was spoken of.\nAnd when they knew what was said, as has been cited above, in the\nprophecies written aforetime, “Strong as a giant to run his\ncourse,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1884\"\u003e1884\u003c/sup\u003e they said that Hercules was\nstrong, and had journeyed over the whole earth.

And the enemy being at hand, the scouts pointed out to\nus, and our general Pompeianus showed us that there was close on us a\nmass of a mixed multitude of 977,000 men, which indeed we saw; and I was\nshut up by this vast host, having with me only a battalion composed of\nthe first, tenth, double and marine legions. Having then examined my own\nposition, and my host, with respect to the vast mass of barbarians and of\nthe enemy, I quickly betook myself to prayer to the gods of my country.\nBut being disregarded by them, I summoned those who among us go by the\nname of Christians. And having made inquiry, I discovered a great number\nand vast host of them, and raged against them, which was by no means\nbecoming; for afterwards I learned their power. Wherefore they began the\nbattle, not by preparing weapons, nor arms, nor bugles; for such\npreparation is hateful to them, on account of the God they bear about in\ntheir conscience. Therefore it is probable that those whom we suppose to\nbe atheists, have God as their ruling power entrenched in their\nconscience. For having cast themselves on the ground, they prayed not\nonly for me, but also for the whole army as it stood, that they might be\ndelivered from the present thirst and famine. For during five days we had\ngot no water, because there was none; for we were in the heart of\nGermany, and in the enemy’s territory. And simultaneously with\ntheir casting themselves on the ground, and praying to God (a God of whom\nI am ignorant), water poured from heaven, upon us most refreshingly cool,\nbut upon the enemies of Rome a withering\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1920\"\u003e1920\u003c/sup\u003e hail. And\nimmediately we recognised the presence of God following on the prayer-a \nGod unconquerable and indestructible. Founding upon this, then,\nlet us pardon such as are Christians, lest they pray for and obtain such\na weapon against ourselves. And I counsel that no such person be accused\non the ground of his being a Christian. But if any one be found laying to\nthe charge of a Christian that he is a Christian, I desire that it be\nmade manifest that he who is accused as a Christian, and acknowledges\nthat he is one, is accused of nothing else than only this, that he is a\nChristian; but that he who arraigns him be burned alive. And I further\ndesire, that he who is entrusted with the government of the province\nshall not compel the Christian, who confesses and certifies such a\nmatter, to retract; neither shall he commit him. And I desire that these\nthings be confirmed by a decree of the Senate. And I command this my\nedict to be published in the Forum of Trajan, in order that it may be\nread.

And when she was overpersuaded by\nher friends, who advised her still to continue with him, in the idea that\nsome time or other her husband might give hope of amendment, she did\nviolence to her own feeling and remained with him. But when her husband\nhad gone into Alexandria, and was reported to be conducting himself worse\nthan ever, she—that she might not, by continuing in matrimonial\nconnection with him, and by sharing his table and his bed, become a\npartaker also in his wickednesses and impieties—gave him what you\ncall a bill of divorce,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1926\"\u003e1926\u003c/sup\u003e and was\nseparated from him.

He persuaded a centurion\n—who had cast Ptolemæus into prison, and who was friendly to\nhimself—to take Ptolemæus and interrogate him on this sole\npoint: whether he were a Christian? And Ptolemæus, being a lover of\ntruth, and not of a deceitful or false disposition, when he confessed\nhimself to be a Christian, was bound by the centurion, and for a long\ntime punished in the prison.

For he who denies anything either denies it because he condemns\nthe thing itself, or he shrinks from confession because he is conscious\nof his own unworthiness or alienation from it, neither of which cases is\nthat of the true Christian. And when Urbicus ordered him to be led away\nto punishment, one Lucius, who was also himself a Christian, seeing the\nunreasonable judgment that had thus been given, said to Urbicus:\n“What is the ground of this judgment? Why have you punished this\nman, not as an adulterer, nor fornicator, nor murderer, nor thief, nor\nrobber, nor convicted of any crime at all, but who has only confessed\nthat he is called by the name of Christian?

For what is the use of that baptism which cleanses the\nflesh and body alone? Baptize the soul from wrath and from covetousness,\nfrom envy, and from hatred; and, lo! the body is pure. For this is the\nsymbolic significance of unleavened bread, that you do not commit the old\ndeeds of wicked leaven. But you have understood all things in a carnal\nsense, and you suppose it to be piety if you do such things, while your\nsouls are filled with deceit, and, in short, with every wickedness.\nAccordingly, also, after the seven days of eating unleavened bread, God\ncommanded them to mingle new leaven, that is, the performance of other\nworks, and not the imitation of the old and evil works. And because this\nis what this new Lawgiver demands of you, I shall again refer to the\nwords which have been quoted by me, and to others also which have been\npassed over. They are related by Isaiah to the following effect:\n‘Hearken to me, and your soul shall live; and I will make with you\nan everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have\ngiven Him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the\nnations. Nations which know not Thee shall call on Thee; and peoples who\nknow not Thee shall escape unto Thee, because of Thy God, the Holy One of\nIsrael, for He has glorified Thee. Seek ye God; and when you find Him,\ncall on Him, so long as He may be nigh you. Let the wicked forsake his\nways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the\nLord, and he will obtain mercy, because He will abundantly pardon your\nsins. For my thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are my ways as\nyour ways; but as far removed as the heavens are from the earth, so far\nis my way removed from your way, and your thoughts from my thoughts. For\nas the snow or the rain descends from heaven, and shall not return till\nit waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to\nthe sower and bread for food, so shall My word be that goeth forth out of\nMy mouth: it shall not return until it shall have\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_202.html\" id=\"viii.iv.xiv-Page_202\" n=\"202\" /\u003e\n\naccomplished all that I desired, and I shall make My\ncommandments prosperous.

For\nwhen Abraham himself was in uncircumcision, he was justified and blessed\nby reason of the faith which he reposed in God, as the Scripture tells.\nMoreover, the Scriptures and the facts themselves compel us to admit that\nHe received circumcision for a sign, and not for righteousness. So that\nit was justly recorded concerning the people, that the soul which shall\nnot be circumcised on the eighth day shall be cut off from his family.\nAnd, furthermore, the inability of the female sex to receive fleshly\ncircumcision, proves that this circumcision has been given for a sign,\nand not for a work of righteousness. For God has given likewise to women\nthe ability to observe all things which are righteous and virtuous; but\nwe see that the bodily form of the male has been made different from the\nbodily form of the female; yet we know that neither of them is righteous\nor unrighteous merely for this cause, but [is considered righteous] by\nreason of piety and righteousness.\u003c/p\u003e",

These are the words:\n‘I beheld till the thrones were set; and the Ancient of days did\nsit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the\npure wool. His throne was like a fiery flame, His wheels as burning fire.\nA fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him. Thousand thousands\nministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before\nHim. The books were opened, and the judgment was set. I beheld then the\nvoice of the great words which the horn speaks: and the beast was beat\ndown, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. And the\nrest of the beasts were taken away from their dominion, and a period of\nlife was given to the beasts until a season and time. I saw in the vision\nof the night, and, behold, one like the Son of man coming with the clouds\nof heaven; and He came to the Ancient of days, and stood before Him. And\nthey who stood by brought Him near; and there were given Him power and\nkingly honour, and all nations of the earth by their families, and all\nglory, serve Him.

And my\nspirit was chilled within my frame, and the visions of my head troubled\nme. I came near unto one of them that stood by, and inquired the precise\nmeaning of all these things. In answer he speaks to me, and showed me the\njudgment of the matters: These great beasts are four kingdoms, which\nshall perish from the earth, and shall not receive dominion for ever,\neven for ever and ever. Then I wished to know exactly about the fourth\nbeast, which destroyed all [the others] and was very terrible, its teeth\nof iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, made waste, and stamped\nthe residue with its feet: also about the ten horns upon its head, and of\nthe one which came up, by means of which three of the former fell.

But it refers also to our\nChrist. But you deceive yourselves by the ambiguous forms of speech. For\nwhere it is said, ‘The law of the Lord is perfect,’ you do\nnot understand it of the law which was to be after Moses, but of the law\nwhich was given by Moses, although God declared that He would establish a\nnew law and a new covenant. And where it has been said, ‘O God,\ngive Thy judgment to the king,’ since Solomon was king, you say\nthat the Psalm refers to him, although the words of the Psalm expressly\nproclaim that reference is made to the everlasting King, i.e., to Christ.\nFor Christ is King, and Priest, and God, and Lord, and angel, and man,\nand captain, and stone, and a Son born, and first made subject to\nsuffering, then returning to heaven, and again coming with glory, and He\nis preached as having the everlasting kingdom: so I prove from all the\nScriptures. But that you may perceive what I have said, I quote the words\nof the Psalm; they are these: ‘O God, give Thy judgment to the\nking, and Thy righteousness unto the king’s son, to judge Thy\npeople with righteousness, and Thy poor with judgment. The mountains\nshall take up peace to the people, and the little hills righteousness. He\nshall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the\nneedy, and shall abase the slanderer. He shall co-endure with the sun,\nand before the moon unto all generations. He shall come down like rain\nupon the fleece, as drops falling on the earth. In His days shall\nrighteousness flourish, and abundance of peace until the moon be taken\naway. And He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the rivers\nunto the ends of the earth. Ethiopians shall fall down before Him, and\nHis enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish and the isles\nshall offer gifts; the kings of Arabia and Seba shall offer gifts; and\nall the kings of the earth shall worship Him, and all the nations shall\nserve Him: for He has delivered the poor from the man of power, and the\nneedy that hath no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall\nsave the souls of the needy: He shall redeem their souls from usury and\ninjustice, and His name shall be honourable before them. And He shall\nlive, and to Him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, and they shall\npray continually for Him: they shall bless Him all the day. And there\nshall be a foundation on the earth, it shall be exalted on the tops of\nthe mountains: His fruit shall be on Lebanon, and they of the city shall\nflourish like grass of the earth. His name shalt be blessed for ever. His\nname shall endure before the sun; and all tribes of the earth shall be\nblessed in Him, all nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord,\nthe God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things; and blessed be His\nglorious name for ever, and for ever and ever; and the whole earth shall\nbe filled with His glory.

And we have received it through baptism,\nsince we were sinners, by God’s mercy; and all men may equally\nobtain it. But since the mystery of His birth now demands our attention I\nshall speak of it. Isaiah then asserted in regard to the generation of\nChrist, that it could not be declared by man, in words already\nquoted:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2068\"\u003e2068\u003c/sup\u003e ‘Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken\nfrom the earth: for the transgressions of my people was He led\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2069\"\u003e2069\u003c/sup\u003e to death.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2070\"\u003e2070\u003c/sup\u003e The\nSpirit of prophecy thus affirmed that the generation of Him who was to\ndie, that we sinful men might be healed by His stripes, was such as could\nnot be declared.

And Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will\nI tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house of David; Is it a\nsmall thing for you to contend with men, and how do you contend with the\nLord? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin\nshall conceive, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called\nImmanuel.

For as the unharnessed colt was a symbol of the Gentiles\neven so the harnessed ass was a symbol of your nation. For you possess\nthe law which was imposed [upon you] by the prophets. Moreover, the\nprophet Zechariah foretold that this same Christ would be smitten, and\nHis disciples scattered: which also took place. For after His crucifixion,\nthe disciples that accompanied Him were dispersed, until He rose from the\ndead, and persuaded them that so it had been prophesied concerning Him,\nthat He would suffer; and being thus persuaded, they went into all the\nworld, and taught these truths.

And He saw that He is not prevailing against him,\nand He touched the broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of\nJacob’s thigh grew stiff while he wrestled with Him. And He said,\nLet Me go, for the day breaketh. But he said, I will not let Thee go,\nexcept Thou bless me. And He said to him, What is thy name? And he said,\nJacob. And He said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel\nshall be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and with men shalt\nbe powerful. And Jacob asked Him, and said, Tell me Thy name. But he\nsaid, Why dost thou ask after My name? And He blessed him there. And\nJacob called the name of that place Peniel,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2154\"\u003e2154\u003c/sup\u003e for I saw God face to face, and my soul\nrejoiced.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2155\"\u003e2155\u003c/sup\u003e And again, in\nother terms, referring to the same Jacob, it says the following:\n‘And Jacob came to Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he\nand all the people that were with him. And there he built an altar, and\ncalled the name of that place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when\nhe fled from the face of his brother Esau. And Deborah, Rebekah’s\nnurse, died, and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and Jacob called\nthe name of it The Oak of Sorrow. And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz,\nwhen he came out from Mesopotamia in Syria, and He blessed him. And God\nsaid to him, Thy name shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel shall be\nthy name.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2156\"\u003e2156\u003c/sup\u003e He is called God,\nand He is and shall be God.” And when all had agreed on these\ngrounds, I continued: “Moreover, I consider it necessary to repeat\nto you the words which narrate how He who is both Angel and God and Lord,\nand who appeared as a man to Abraham, and who wrestled in human form with\nJacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother Esau. They are as\nfollows: ‘And Jacob went out from the well of the oath,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2157\"\u003e2157\u003c/sup\u003e and went toward Charran.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2158\"\u003e2158\u003c/sup\u003e And he lighted on a spot, and slept\nthere, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones of the place,\nand put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed,\nand, behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to\nheaven; and the angels of God ascended and descended upon it. And the\nLord stood\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2159\"\u003e2159\u003c/sup\u003e above it, and He said, I am the\nLord, the God of Abraham thy father, and of Isaac; be not afraid: the\nland whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy\nseed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall be extended to the\nwest, and south, and north, and east: and in thee, and in thy seed, shall\nall families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee,\nkeeping thee in every way wherein thou goest, and will bring thee again\ninto this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done all that I\nhave spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said,\nSurely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And he was afraid,\nand said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other than the house\nof God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up in the morning,\nand took the stone which he had placed under his head, and he set it up\nfor a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it; and Jacob called the\nname of the place The House of God, and the name of the city formerly was\nUlammaus.’ ”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2160\"\u003e2160\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Listen, therefore, to the following\nfrom the book of Joshua, that what I say may become manifest to you; it\nis this: ‘And it came to pass, when Joshua was near Jericho, he\nlifted up his eyes, and sees a man standing over against him.

And\nHe said to him, I am Captain of the Lord’s host: now have I come.\nAnd Joshua fell on his face on the ground, and said to Him, Lord, what\ncommandest Thou Thy servant? And the Lord’s Captain says to Joshua,\nLoose the shoes off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy\nground.

Then the eyes of the\nblind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear. Then the lame\nshall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be\ndistinct: for water has broken forth in the wilderness, and a valley in\nthe thirsty land; and the parched ground shall become pools, and a spring\nof water shall [rise up] in the thirsty land.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2209\"\u003e2209\u003c/sup\u003e The spring of living water which\ngushed forth from God in the land destitute of the knowledge of God,\nnamely the land of the Gentiles, was this Christ, who also appeared in\nyour nation, and healed those who were maimed, and deaf, and lame in body\nfrom their birth, causing them to leap, to hear, and to see, by His word.\nAnd having raised the dead, and causing them to live, by His deeds He\ncompelled the men who lived at that time to recognise Him. But though\nthey saw such works, they asserted it was magical art. For they dared to\ncall Him a magician, and a deceiver of the people. Yet He wrought such\nworks, and persuaded those who were [destined to] believe on Him; for\neven if any one be labouring under a defect of body, yet be an observer\nof the doctrines delivered by Him, He shall raise him up at His second\nadvent perfectly sound, after He has made him immortal, and\nincorruptible, and free from grief.\u003c/p\u003e",

For he\ndeclares that, in saying ‘like unto the Son of man,’ He\nappeared, and was man, but not of human seed. And the same thing he\nproclaimed in mystery when he speaks of this stone which was cut out\nwithout hands. For the expression ‘it was cut out without\nhands’ signified that it is not a work of man, but [a work] of the\nwill of the Father and God of all things, who brought Him forth. And when\nIsaiah says, ‘Who shall declare His generation?’ he meant\nthat His descent could not be declared. Now no one who is a man of men\nhas a descent that cannot be declared. And when Moses says that He will\nwash His garments in the blood of the grape, does not this signify what I\nhave now often told you is an obscure prediction, namely, that He had\nblood, but not from men; just as not man, but God, has begotten the blood\nof the vine? And when Isaiah calls Him the Angel of mighty counsel,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2234\"\u003e2234\u003c/sup\u003e did he not foretell Him to\nbe the Teacher of those truths which He did teach when He came [to\nearth]?

For it will not be conceded to you, as you wish\nto explain it, that Hezekiah waged war with the inhabitants of Damascus\nand Samaria in presence of the king of Assyria. ‘For before the\nchild knows how to call father or mother,’ the prophetic word said,\n‘He shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria in\npresence of the king of Assyria.’ For if the Spirit of prophecy had\nnot made the statement with an addition, ‘Before the child knows\nhow to call father or mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and\nspoils of Samaria,’ but had only said, ‘And shall bear a son,\nand he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,’\nthen you might say that God foretold that he would take these things,\nsince He foreknew it.

Therefore we are most anxious that you be persuaded\nnot to be misled by such persons, since we know that every one who can\nspeak the truth, and yet speaks it not, shall be judged by God, as God\ntestified by Ezekiel, when He said, ‘I have made thee a watchman to\nthe house of Judah.

But you\nin these matters venture to pervert the expositions which your elders\nthat were with Ptolemy king of Egypt gave forth, since you assert that\nthe Scripture is not so as they have expounded it, but says,\n‘Behold, the young woman shall conceive,’ as if great events\nwere to be inferred if a woman should beget from sexual intercourse:\nwhich indeed all young women, with the exception of the barren, do; but\neven these, God, if He wills, is able to cause [to bear]. For\nSamuel’s mother, who was barren, brought forth by the will of God;\nand so also the wife of the holy patriarch Abraham; and Elisabeth, who\nbore John the Baptist, and other such.

By this he\nsaw the water gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the\nwaters of Marah, which were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting\nrods into the water-troughs, caused the sheep of his uncle to conceive,\nso that he should obtain their young. With his rod the same Jacob boasts\nthat he had crossed the river. He said he had seen a ladder, and the\nScripture has declared that God stood above it. But that this was not the\nFather, we have proved from the Scriptures. And Jacob, having poured oil\non a stone in the same place, is testified to by the very God who\nappeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God who appeared to\nhim. And that the stone symbolically proclaimed Christ, we have also\nproved by many Scriptures; and that the unguent, whether it was of oil,\nor of \u003ci\u003estacte\u003c/i\u003e,,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2286\"\u003e2286\u003c/sup\u003e or of any other\ncompounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also proved,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2287\"\u003e2287\u003c/sup\u003e inasmuch as the word says:\n‘Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of\ngladness above Thy fellows.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2288\"\u003e2288\u003c/sup\u003e For indeed\nall kings and anointed persons obtained from Him their share in the names\nof kings and anointed: just as He Himself received from the Father the\ntitles of King, and Christ, and Priest, and Angel, and such like other\ntitles which He bears or did bear. Aaron’s rod, which blossomed,\ndeclared him to be the high priest. Isaiah prophesied that a rod would\ncome forth from the root of Jesse, [and this was] Christ. And David says\nthat the righteous man is ‘like the tree that is planted by the\nchannels of waters, which should yield its fruit in its season, and whose\nleaf should not fade.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2289\"\u003e2289\u003c/sup\u003e Again, the\nrighteous is said to flourish like the palm-tree.

Moreover, it was a rod that pointed out Judah to be\nthe father of Tamar’s sons by a great mystery.”\u003c/p\u003e",

For we may see that\nsuch persons are unwilling to submit to the same things which they\ninflict upon others, and reproach each other with hostile consciences for\nthe acts which they perpetrate. And hence I think that our Lord and Saviour\nJesus Christ spoke well when He summed up all righteousness and piety in\ntwo commandments. They are these: ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thy heart, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as\nthyself.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2313\"\u003e2313\u003c/sup\u003e For the man who loves\nGod with all the heart, and with all the strength, being filled with a\nGod-fearing mind, will reverence no other god; and since God wishes it,\nhe would reverence that angel who is beloved by the same Lord and God.\nAnd the man who loves his neighbour as himself will wish for him the same\ngood things that he wishes for himself, and no man will wish evil things\nfor himself. Accordingly, he who loves his neighbour would pray and\nlabour that his neighbour may be possessed of the same benefits as\nhimself. Now nothing else is neighbour to man than that\nsimilarly-affectioned and reasonable being—man. Therefore, since\nall righteousness is divided into two branches, namely, in so far as it\nregards God and men, whoever, says the Scripture, loves the Lord God with\nall the heart, and all the strength, and his neighbour as himself, would\nbe truly a righteous man. But you were never\nshown to be possessed of friendship or love either towards God, or\ntowards the prophets, or towards yourselves, but, as is evident, you are\never found to be idolaters and murderers of righteous men, so that you\nlaid hands even on Christ Himself; and to this very day you abide in your\nwickedness, execrating those who prove that this man who was crucified by\nyou is the Christ. Nay, more than this, you suppose that He was crucified\nas hostile to and cursed by God, which supposition is the product of your\nmost irrational mind. For though you have the means of understanding that\nthis man is Christ from the signs given by Moses, yet you will not; but,\nin addition, fancying that we can have no arguments, you put whatever\nquestion comes into your minds, while you yourselves are at a loss for\narguments whenever you meet with some firmly established Christian.\u003c/p\u003e",

As soon as He was born in Bethlehem, as I\npreviously remarked, king Herod, having learned from the Arabian Magi\nabout Him, made a plot to put Him to death, and by God’s command\nJoseph took Him with Mary and departed into Egypt. For the Father had\ndecreed that He whom He had begotten should be put to death, but not\nbefore He had grown to manhood, and proclaimed the word which proceeded\nfrom Him. But if any of you say to us, Could not God rather have put\nHerod to death?

Hence Scripture says the\nfollowing, at the destruction of the tower, and division and alteration\nof tongues: ‘And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they\nhave all one language; and this they have begun to do: and now nothing\nwill be restrained from them of all which they have attempted to\ndo.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2338\"\u003e2338\u003c/sup\u003e And the statement, ‘My\nstrength is become dry like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved to my\nthroat,’ was also a prophecy of what would be done by Him according\nto the Father’s will.

And again,\nby what Moses and Joshua did, the same thing was symbolically announced\nand told beforehand. For the one of them, stretching out his hands,\nremained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and this\nreveals a type of no other thing than of the cross: and the other, whose\nname was altered to Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, and Israel conquered.\nNow this took place in the case of both those holy men and prophets of\nGod, that you may perceive how one of them could not bear up both the\nmysteries: I mean, the type of the cross and the type of the name. For\nthis is, was, and shall be the strength of Him alone, whose name every\npower dreads, being very much tormented because they shall be destroyed\nby Him. Therefore our suffering and crucified Christ was not cursed by\nthe law, but made it manifest that He alone would save those who do not\ndepart from His faith. And the blood of the passover, sprinkled on each\nman’s door-posts and lintel, delivered those who were saved in\nEgypt, when the first-born of the Egyptians were destroyed. For the\npassover was Christ, who was afterwards sacrificed, as also Isaiah said,\n‘He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2370\"\u003e2370\u003c/sup\u003e And it is written, that on the day of the passover you seized\nHim, and that also during the passover you crucified Him.

Would God, then,\nhave been deceived if this sign had not been above the doors? I do not\nsay that; but I affirm that He announced beforehand the future salvation\nfor the human race through the blood of Christ. For the sign of the\nscarlet thread, which the spies, sent to Jericho by Joshua, son of Nave\n(Nun), gave to Rahab the harlot, telling her to bind it to the window\nthrough which she let them down to escape from their enemies, also\nmanifested the symbol of the blood of Christ, by which those who were at\none time harlots and unrighteous persons out of all nations are saved,\nreceiving remission of sins, and continuing no longer in sin.\u003c/p\u003e",

And unless those who read perceive\nthis art, they will not be able to follow the words of the prophets as\nthey ought. For example’s sake, I shall repeat some prophetic\npassages, that you may understand what I say. When He speaks by Isaiah,\n‘He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before the\nshearer,’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2376\"\u003e2376\u003c/sup\u003e He speaks as if the\nsuffering had already taken place. And when He says again, ‘I have\nstretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying\npeople;’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2377\"\u003e2377\u003c/sup\u003e and when He says,\n‘Lord, who hath believed our report?’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2378\"\u003e2378\u003c/sup\u003e—the words are spoken as if announcing events which had\nalready come to pass. For I have shown that Christ is oftentimes called a\nStone in parable, and in figurative speech Jacob and Israel. And again,\nwhen He says, ‘I shall behold the heavens, the works of Thy\nfingers,’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2379\"\u003e2379\u003c/sup\u003e unless I understand His\nmethod of using words,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2380\"\u003e2380\u003c/sup\u003e I shall not understand intelligently, but\njust as your teachers suppose, fancying that the Father of all, the\nunbegotten God, has hands and feet, and fingers, and a soul, like a\ncomposite being; and they for this reason teach that it was the Father\nHimself who appeared to Abraham and to Jacob. Blessed therefore are we who have been\ncircumcised the second time with knives of stone. For your first\ncircumcision was and is performed by iron instruments, for you remain\nhard-hearted; but our circumcision, which is the second, having been\ninstituted after yours, circumcises us from idolatry and from absolutely\nevery kind of wickedness by sharp stones, i.e., by the words [preached]\nby the apostles of the corner-stone cut out without hands. And our hearts\nare thus circumcised from evil, so that we are happy to die for the name\nof the good Rock, which causes living water to burst forth for the hearts\nof those who by Him have loved the Father of all, and which gives those\nwho are willing to drink of the water of life. But you do not comprehend\nme when I speak these things; for you have not understood what it has\nbeen prophesied that Christ would do, and you do not believe us who draw\nyour attention to what has been written. For Jeremiah thus cries:\n‘Woe unto you! because you have forsaken the living fountain, and\nhave digged for yourselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Shall\nthere be a wilderness where Mount Zion is, because I gave Jerusalem a\nbill of divorce in your sight?’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2381\"\u003e2381\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Then he goes on\nto say: ‘And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three\nmen stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet\nthem.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2442\"\u003e2442\u003c/sup\u003e After a little, one of\nthem promises a son to Abraham: ‘Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,\nShall I of a surety bear a child, and I am old? Is anything impossible\nwith God? At the time appointed I will return, according to the time of\nlife, and Sarah shall have a son. And they went away from\nAbraham.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2443\"\u003e2443\u003c/sup\u003e Again he speaks of\nthem thus: ‘And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward\nSodom.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2444\"\u003e2444\u003c/sup\u003e Then to Abraham He who\nwas and is again speaks: ‘I will not hide from Abraham, my servant,\nwhat I intend to do.’ ”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2445\"\u003e2445\u003c/sup\u003e And\nwhat follows in the writings of Moses I quoted and explained; “from\nwhich I have demonstrated,” I said, “that He who is described\nas God appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and the other\npatriarchs, was appointed under the authority of the Father and Lord, and\nministers to His will.” Then I went on to say what I had not said\nbefore: “And so, when the people desired to eat flesh, and Moses\nhad lost faith in Him, who also there is called the Angel, and who\npromised that God would give them to satiety, He who is both God and the\nAngel, sent by the Father, is described as saying and doing these things.\nFor thus the Scripture says: ‘And the Lord said to Moses, Will the\nLord’s hand not be sufficient? thou shalt know now whether my word\nshall conceal thee or not.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2446\"\u003e2446\u003c/sup\u003e And again,\nin other words, it thus says: ‘But the Lord spake unto me, Thou\nshalt not go over this Jordan: the Lord thy God, who goeth before thy\nface, He shall cut off the nations.’\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2447\"\u003e2447\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

In this way, they teach, He made the angels. But it is proved\nthat there are angels who always exist, and are never reduced to that\nform out of which they sprang. And that this power which the prophetic\nword calls God, as has been also amply demonstrated, and Angel, is not\nnumbered [as different] in name only like the light of the sun, but is\nindeed something numerically distinct, I have discussed briefly in what\nhas gone before; when I asserted that this power was begotten from the\nFather, by His power and will, but not by abscission, as if the essence\nof the Father were divided; as all other things partitioned and divided\nare not the same after as before they were divided: and, for the sake of\nexample, I took the case of fires kindled from a fire, which we see to be\ndistinct from it, and yet that from which many can be kindled is by no\nmeans made less, but remains the same.\u003c/p\u003e",

And it is\nwritten in the book of Wisdom: ‘If I should tell you daily events,\nI would be mindful to enumerate them from the beginning. The Lord created\nme the beginning of His ways for His works. From everlasting He\nestablished me in the beginning, before He formed the earth, and before\nHe made the depths, and before the springs of waters came forth, before\nthe mountains were settled; He begets me before all the hills.’\n”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2457\"\u003e2457\u003c/sup\u003e When I repeated these words, I added:\n“You perceive, my hearers, if you bestow attention, that the\nScripture has declared that this Offspring was begotten by the Father\nbefore all things created; and that which is begotten is numerically\ndistinct from that which begets, any one will admit.”\u003c/p\u003e",

It\nwill do your cause no good to say so to men who know the poets; for they\nknow how very ridiculous a theogony they have composed,—as we can\nlearn from Homer, your most distinguished and prince of poets. For he\nsays, first, that the gods were in the beginning generated from water;\nfor he has written thus:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2508\"\u003e2508\u003c/sup\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.ii-p3\"\u003eAnd then we must also remind you of what he further\nsays of him whom ye consider the first of the gods, and whom he often\ncalls “the father of gods and men;” for he said:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2509\"\u003e2509\u003c/sup\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.ii-p5\"\u003eIndeed, he says that he was not only the dispenser of\nwar to the army, but also the cause of perjury to the Trojans, by means\nof his daughter;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2510\"\u003e2510\u003c/sup\u003e and Homer introduces him in love, and bitterly\ncomplaining, and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the other\ngods, and at one time exclaiming concerning his own son:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2511\"\u003e2511\u003c/sup\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.ii-p8\"\u003eAnd at another time concerning Hector:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2512\"\u003e2512\u003c/sup\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.ii-p10\"\u003eAnd what he says of the conspiracy of the other gods\nagainst Zeus, they know who read these words:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2513\"\u003e2513\u003c/sup\u003e\n“When the other Olympians—Juno, and Neptune, and Minerva\n—wished to bind him.” And unless the blessed gods had feared\nhim whom gods call Briareus, Zeus would have been bound by them. And what\nHomer says of his intemperate loves, we must remind you in the very words\nhe used. For he said that Zeus spake thus to Juno:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2514\"\u003e2514\u003c/sup\u003e—\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_274.html\" id=\"viii.vi.ii-Page_274\" n=\"274\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.ii-p13\"\u003eIt is fit that we now mention what one can learn from\nthe work of Homer of the other gods, and what they suffered at the hands\nof men. For he says that Mars and Venus were wounded by Diomed, and of\nmany others of the gods he relates the sufferings. For thus we can gather\nfrom the case of Dione consoling her daughter; for she said to her:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2515\"\u003e2515\u003c/sup\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.ii-p15\"\u003eBut if it is right to remind you of the battle of the\ngods, opposed to one another, your own poet himself will recount it,\nsaying:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2516\"\u003e2516\u003c/sup\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.ii-p17\"\u003eThese and such like things did Homer teach you; and not\nHomer only, but also Hesiod.

Thirdly, Anaximenes—and he\ntoo was from Miletus—says that air is the first principle of all\nthings; for he says that from this all things are produced, and into this\nall are resolved. Heraclitus\nand Hippasus, from Metapontus, say that fire is the first principle of\nall things; for from fire all things proceed, and in fire do all things\nterminate. Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ said that the homogeneous parts are\nthe first principles of all things. Archelaus, the son of Apollodorus, an\nAthenian, says that the infinite air and its density and rarity are the\nfirst principle of all things.

For these, they say, have learned the perfect and true\nreligion. But I would be glad to ask, first of all, from those who say\nso, from whom they say that these men have learned this knowledge; for it\nis impossible that men who have not learned these so great and divine\nmatters from some who knew them, should either themselves know them, or\nbe able correctly to teach others; and, in the second place, I think we\nought to examine the opinions even of these sages.

Thus, at least, he wrote: “Not, as some of those\nwho have erred regarding the Deity say, that God exists in a fiery\nsubstance.” Then, as if he were not satisfied with this blasphemy\nagainst Plato, he further, for the sake of proving what he says about the\nætherial body, cites as a witness him whom Plato had banished from his\nrepublic as a liar, and as being an imitator of the images of truth at\nthree removes,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2523\"\u003e2523\u003c/sup\u003e for so Plato calls Homer; for he wrote:\n“Thus at least did Homer speak,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2524\"\u003e2524\u003c/sup\u003e ‘And Zeus\nobtained the wide heaven in the air and the clouds,’ ”\nwishing to make his own opinion appear more worthy of credit by the\ntestimony of Homer; not being aware that if he used Homer as a witness to\nprove that he spoke truth, many of his tenets would be proved untrue.

And he conjectures this, first, from the fact that\nthe seed of all living creatures, which is their first principle, is\nmoist; and secondly, because all plants grow and bear fruit in moisture,\nbut when deprived of moisture, wither.

And he in the first\nbook, having said that he had learned from the Egyptian priests that\nMoses was an ancient lawgiver, and even the first, wrote of him in these\nvery words: “For subsequent to the ancient manner of living in\nEgypt which gods and heroes are fabled to have regulated, they say that\nMoses\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2537\"\u003e2537\u003c/sup\u003e first persuaded the people to use written\nlaws, and to live by them; and he is recorded to have been a man both\ngreat of soul and of great faculty in social matters.” Then, having\nproceeded a little further, and wishing to mention the ancient lawgivers,\nhe mentions Moses first.

And they say that Sasunchis was the second Egyptian\nlegislator, a man of excellent understanding. And the third, they say,\nwas Sesonchosis the king, who not only performed the most brilliant\nmilitary exploits of any in Egypt, but also consolidated that warlike\nrace by legislation. And the fourth lawgiver, they say, was Bocchoris the\nking, a wise and surpassingly skilful man. And after him it is said that\nAmasis the king acceded to the government, whom they relate to have\nregulated all that pertains to the rulers of provinces, and to the\ngeneral administration of the government of Egypt.

But lest, by a complete survey of the\nperiods, and by the use of a greater number of proofs, I should seem to\nbe prolix, I think it may be sufficiently demonstrated from the\nfollowing. For Socrates was the teacher of Plato, and Plato of Aristotle.\nNow these men flourished in the time of Philip and Alexander of Macedon,\nin which time also the Athenian orators flourished, as the Philippics of\nDemosthenes plainly show us. And those who have narrated the deeds of\nAlexander sufficiently prove that during his reign Aristotle associated\nwith him. From all manner of proofs, then, it is easy to see that the\nhistory of Moses is by far more ancient than all profane\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2540\"\u003e2540\u003c/sup\u003e histories. And, besides, it is\nfit that you recognise this fact also, that nothing has been accurately\nrecorded by Greeks before the era of the Olympiads, and that there is no\nancient work which makes known any action of the Greeks or Barbarians.\nBut before that period existed only the history of the prophet Moses,\nwhich he wrote in the Hebrew character by the divine inspiration. For the\nGreek character was not yet in use, as the teachers of language\nthemselves prove, telling us that Cadmus first brought the letters from\nPhœnicia, and communicated them to the Greeks. And your first of\nphilosophers, Plato, testifies that they were a recent discovery. For in\nthe \u003ci\u003eTimæus\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2541\"\u003e2541\u003c/sup\u003e he wrote that Solon, the wisest of the wise men, on his\nreturn from Egypt, said to Critias that he had heard this from a very\naged Egyptian priest, who said to him, “O Solon, Solon, you Greeks\nare ever children, and aged Greek there is none.” Then again he\nsaid, “You are all youths in soul, for you hold no ancient opinion\nderived through remote tradition, nor any system of instruction hoary\nwith time; but all these things escape your knowledge, because for many\ngenerations the posterity of these ancient ages died mute, not having the\nuse of letters.” It is fit, therefore, that you understand that it\nis the fact that every history has been written in these\nrecently-discovered Greek letters; and if any one would make mention of\nold poets, or legislators, or historians, or philosophers, or orators, he\nwill find that they wrote their own works in the Greek character.\u003c/p\u003e",

For having formerly stated that\nhe said that everything which is produced is perishable, he now\nintroduces him saying the very opposite; and he does not see that it is\nthus absolutely impossible for him to escape the charge of falsehood. For\nhe either at first uttered what is false when he said that everything\nwhich is produced is perishable, or now, when he propounds the very\nopposite to what he had formerly said. For if, according to his former\ndefinition, it is absolutely necessary that every created thing be\nperishable, how can he consistently make that possible which is\nabsolutely impossible? So that Plato seems to grant an empty and\nimpossible prerogative to his “maker,” when he propounds that\nthose who were once perishable because made from matter should again, by\nhis intervention, become imperishable and enduring. For it is quite\nnatural that the power of matter, which, according to Plato’s\nopinion, is uncreated, and contemporary and coæval with the maker,\nshould resist his will. For he who has not created has no power, in\nrespect of that which is uncreated, so that it is not possible that it\n(matter), being free, can be controlled by any external necessity.\nWherefore Plato himself, in consideration of this, has written thus:\n“It is necessary to affirm that God cannot suffer\nviolence.”\u003c/p\u003e",

For those who think\nthat the Deity is inflexible, are by no means moved to abandon their\nsins, since they suppose that they will derive no benefit from\nrepentance. How, then, does Plato the philosopher condemn the poet Homer\nfor saying, “Even the gods themselves are not inflexible,”\nand yet himself represent the maker of the gods as so easily turned, that\nhe sometimes declares the gods to be mortal, and at other times declares\nthe same to be immortal? And not only concerning them, but also\nconcerning matter, from which, as he says, it is necessary that the\ncreated gods have been produced, he sometimes says that it is uncreated,\nand at other times that it is created; and yet he does not see that he\nhimself, when he says that the maker of the gods is so easily turned, is\nconvicted of having fallen into the very errors for which he blames\nHomer, though Homer said the very opposite concerning the maker of the\ngods. For he said that he spoke thus of himself:—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"viii.vi.xxv-p3\"\u003eBut Plato, as it seems, unwillingly entered not these\nstrange dissertations concerning the gods, for he feared those who were\nattached to polytheism. And whatever he thinks fit to tell of all\nthat he had learned from Moses and the prophets concerning one God, he\npreferred delivering in a mystical style, so that those who desired to be\nworshippers of God might have an inkling of his own opinion. For being\ncharmed with that saying of God to Moses, “I am the really\nexisting,” and accepting with a great deal of thought the brief\nparticipial expression, he understood that God desired to signify to\nMoses His eternity, and therefore said, “I am the really\nexisting;” for this word “existing” expresses not one\ntime only, but the three—the past, the present, and the future.\nFor when Plato says, “and which never really is,” he uses the\nverb “is” of time indefinite. For the word\n“never” is not spoken, as some suppose, of the past, but of\nthe future time. And this has been accurately understood even by profane\nwriters. And therefore, when Plato wished, as it were, to interpret to\nthe uninitiated what had been mystically expressed by the participle\nconcerning the eternity of God, he employed the following language:\n“God indeed, as the old tradition runs, includes the beginning, and\nend, and middle of all things.” In this sentence he plainly and\nobviously names the law of Moses “the old tradition,”\nfearing, through dread of the hemlock-cup, to mention the name of Moses;\nfor he understood that the teaching of the man was hateful to the Greeks;\nand he clearly enough indicates Moses by the antiquity of the tradition.\nAnd we have sufficiently proved from Diodorus and the rest of the\nhistorians, in the foregoing chapters, that the law of Moses is not only\nold, but even the first. For Diodorus says that he was the first of all\nlawgivers; the letters which belong to the Greeks, and which they\nemployed in the writing of their histories, having not yet been\ndiscovered.\u003c/p\u003e",

He said, then, that the person who was asked said: He\nneither comes nor ever will come hither. For we saw, among other terrible\nsights, this also. When we were close to the mouth [of the pit], and were\nabout to return to the upper air, and had suffered everything else, we\nsuddenly beheld both him and others likewise, most of whom were tyrants.\nBut there were also some private sinners who had committed great crimes.\nAnd these, when they thought they were to ascend, the mouth would not\npermit, but bellowed when any of those who were so incurably wicked\nattempted to ascend, unless they had paid the full penalty. Then fierce\nmen, fiery to look at, stood close by, and hearing the din,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2564\"\u003e2564\u003c/sup\u003e took some and led them away; but Ardiæus and the\nrest, having bound hand and foot, and striking their heads down, and\nflaying, they dragged to the road outside, tearing them with thorns, and\nsignifying to those who were present the cause of their suffering these\nthings, and that they were leading them away to cast them into Tartarus.\nHence, he said, that amidst all their various fears, this one was the\ngreatest, lest the mouth should bellow when they ascended, since if it\nwere silent each one would most gladly ascend; and that the punishments\nand torments were such as these, and that, on the other hand, the rewards\nwere the reverse of these.” Here Plato seems to me to have learnt\nfrom the prophets not only the doctrine of the judgment, but also of the\nresurrection, which the Greeks refuse to believe. For his saying that the\nsoul is judged along with the body, proves nothing more clearly than that\nhe believed the doctrine of the resurrection. Since how could Ardiæus\nand the rest have undergone such punishment in Hades, had they left on\nearth the body, with its head, hands, feet, and skin? For certainly they\nwill never say that the soul has a head and hands, and feet and skin.

For Socrates said that he was on this account called wise,\nbecause, while other men pretended to know what they were ignorant of, he\nhimself did not shrink from confessing that he knew nothing. For he said,\n“I seem to myself to be wisest by this little particular, that what\nI do not know, I do not suppose I know.” Let no one fancy that\nSocrates ironically feigned ignorance, because he often used to do so in\nhis dialogues. For the last expression of his apology which he uttered as\nhe was being led away to the prison, proves that in seriousness and truth\nhe was confessing his ignorance: “But now it is time to go away, I\nindeed to die, but you to live. And which of us goes to the better state,\nis hidden to all but God.” Socrates, indeed, having uttered this\nlast sentence in the Areopagus, departed to the prison, ascribing to God\nalone the knowledge of those things which are hidden from us; but those\nwho came after him, though they are unable to comprehend even earthly\nthings, profess to understand things heavenly as if they had seen them.\nAristotle at least—as if he had seen things heavenly with greater\naccuracy than Plato—declared that God did not exist, as Plato\nsaid, in the fiery substance (for this was Plato’s doctrine) but in\nthe fifth element, air. And while he demanded that concerning these\nmatters he should be believed on account of the excellence of his\nlanguage, he yet departed this life because he was overwhelmed with the\ninfamy and disgrace of being unable to discover even the nature of the\nEuripus in Chalcis.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2587\"\u003e2587\u003c/sup\u003e Let not any one, therefore, of\nsound judgment prefer the elegant diction of these men to his own\nsalvation, but let him, according to that old story, stop his ears with\nwax, and flee the sweet hurt which these sirens would inflict upon him.\nFor the above-mentioned men, presenting their elegant language as a kind\nof bait, have sought to seduce many from the right religion, in imitation\nof him who dared to teach the first men polytheism.

Now let this argument stand\nor fall by this one assertion. For this being proved false, their whole\nobjection will be removed. Now it is indeed evident that the members\nwhich discharge functions discharge those functions which in the present\nlife we see, but it does not follow that they necessarily discharge the\nsame functions from the beginning. And that this may be more clearly\nseen, let us consider it thus. The function of the womb is to become\npregnant; and of the member of the male to impregnate. But as, though\nthese members are destined to discharge such functions, it is not\ntherefore necessary that they from the beginning discharge them (since we\nsee many women who do not become pregnant, as those that are barren, even\nthough they have wombs), so pregnancy is not the immediate and necessary\nconsequence of having a womb; but those even who are not barren abstain\nfrom sexual intercourse, some being virgins from the first, and others\nfrom a certain time.

So that both in the case of men\nand the irrational animals we can see sexual intercourse abolished; and\nthis, too, before the future world.

For if the flesh were deprived of food, drink, and\nclothing, it would be destroyed; but being deprived of lawless desire, it\nsuffers no harm. And at the same time He foretold that, in the future\nworld, sexual intercourse should be done away with; as He says,\n“The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage; but\nthe children of the world to come neither marry nor are given in\nmarriage, but shall be like the angels in heaven.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2617\"\u003e2617\u003c/sup\u003e Let not, then, those that are unbelieving marvel, if in the world\nto come He do away with those acts of our fleshly members which even in\nthis present life are abolished.\u003c/p\u003e",

For it is\nsufficient to mention the most prevalent opinions. And Plato says that\nall things are made from matter by God, and according to His design; but\nEpicures and his followers say that all things are made from the atom and\nthe void by some kind of self-regulating action of the natural movement\nof the bodies; and the Stoics, that all are made of the four elements,\nGod pervading them. But while there is such discrepancy among them, there\nare some doctrines acknowledged by them all in common, one of which is\nthat neither can anything be produced from what is not in being, nor\nanything be destroyed or dissolved into what has not any being, and that\nthe elements exist indestructible out of which all things are generated.\nAnd this being so, the regeneration of the flesh will, according to all\nthese philosophers, appear to be possible. For if, according to Plato, it\nis matter and God, both these are indestructible and God; and God indeed\noccupies the position of an artificer, to wit, a potter; and matter\noccupies the place of clay or wax, or some such thing. That, then, which\nis formed of matter, be it an image or a statue, is destructible; but the\nmatter itself is indestructible, such as clay or wax, or any other such\nkind of matter. Thus the artist designs in the clay or wax, and makes the\nform of a living animal; and again, if his handiwork be destroyed, it is\nnot impossible for him to make the same form, by working up the same\nmaterial, and fashioning it anew. So that, according to Plato, neither\nwill it be impossible for God, who is Himself indestructible, and has\nalso indestructible material, even after that which has been first formed\nof it has been destroyed, to make it anew again, and to make the same\nform just as it was before. But according to the Stoics even, the body\nbeing produced by the mixture of the four elementary substances, when\nthis body has been dissolved into the four elements, these remaining\nindestructible, it is possible that they receive a second time the same\nfusion and composition, from God pervading them, and so re-make the body\nwhich they formerly made. Like as if a man shall make a composition of\ngold and silver, and brass and tin, and then shall wish to dissolve it\nagain, so that each element exist separately, having again mixed them, he\nmay, if he pleases, make the very same composition as he had formerly\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_297.html\" id=\"viii.viii.vi-Page_297\" n=\"297\" /\u003e\n\nmade. Again, according to Epicurus, the atoms and the void being\nindestructible, it is by a definite arrangement and adjustment of the\natoms as they come together, that both all other formations are produced,\nand the body itself; and it being in course of time dissolved, is\ndissolved again into those atoms from which it was also produced. And as\nthese remain indestructible, it is not at all impossible, that by coming\ntogether again, and receiving the same arrangement and position, they\nshould make a body of like nature to what was formerly produced by them;\nas if a jeweller should make in mosaic the form of an animal, and the\nstones should be scattered by time or by the man himself who made them,\nhe having still in his possession the scattered stones, may gather them\ntogether again, and having gathered, may dispose them in the same way,\nand make the same form of an animal.

Then the sculptor and\npainter, if they wish the works they have made to endure, that they may\nwin glory by them, renew them when they begin to decay; but God would so\nneglect His own possession and work, that it becomes annihilated, and no\nlonger exists. Should we not call this labour in vain? As if a man who\nhas built a house should forthwith destroy it, or should neglect it,\nthough he sees it falling into decay, and is able to repair it: we would\nblame him for labouring in vain; and should we not so blame God?

For it had its salvation from itself; so that in\nsaving the soul, God does no great thing. For to be saved is its natural\ndestiny, because it is a part of Himself, being His inspiration. But no\nthanks are due to one who saves what is his own; for this is to save\nhimself. For he who saves a part himself, saves himself by his own means,\nlest he become defective in that part; and this is not the act of a good\nman. For not even when a man does good to his children and offspring,\ndoes one call him a good man; for even the most savage of the wild beasts\ndo so, and indeed willingly endure death, if need be, for the sake of\ntheir cubs.

Considering, therefore, even such arguments\nas are suited to this world, and finding that, even according to them, it\nis not impossible that the flesh be regenerated; and seeing that, besides\nall these proofs, the Saviour in the whole Gospel shows that there is\nsalvation for the flesh, why do we any longer endure those unbelieving\nand dangerous arguments, and fail to see that we are retrograding when we\nlisten to such an argument as this: that the soul is immortal, but the\nbody mortal, and incapable of being revived?

But because the\nprince of wickedness could in no other way corrupt the truth, he sent\nforth his apostles (evil men who introduced pestilent doctrines),\nchoosing them from among those who crucified our Saviour; and these men\nbore the name of the Saviour, but did the works of him that sent them,\nthrough whom the name itself has been spoken against. But if the flesh do\nnot rise, why is it also guarded, and why do we not rather suffer it to\nindulge its desires? Why do we not imitate physicians, who, it is said,\nwhen they get a patient that is despaired of and incurable, allow him to\nindulge his desires? For they know that he is dying; and this indeed\nthose who hate the flesh surely do, casting it out of its inheritance, so\nfar as they can; for on this account they also despise it, because it is\nshortly to become a corpse. But if our physician Christ, God, having\nrescued us from our desires, regulates our flesh with His own wise and\ntemperate rule, it is evident that He guards it from sins because it\npossesses a hope of salvation, as physicians do not suffer men whom they\nhope to save to indulge in what pleasures they please.\n\neven before we learned the truth.\nIf then the Saviour said this, and proclaimed salvation to the soul\nalone, what new thing, beyond what we heard from Pythagoras and Plato and\nall their band, did He bring us?
