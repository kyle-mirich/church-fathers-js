By far\nthe most learned and elaborate work maintaining this position was that of\nDaillé (or Dallæus), published in 1666. This drew forth in reply the\ncelebrated \u003ci\u003eVindiciæ\u003c/i\u003e of Bishop Pearson, which appeared in 1672. It\nwas generally supposed that this latter work had established on an\nimmoveable foundation the genuineness of the shorter form of the Ignatian\nEpistles; and, as we have stated above, this was the conclusion almost\nuniversally accepted down to our own day.

Thus said Lardner, in his \u003ci\u003eCredibility of the Gospel\nHistory\u003c/i\u003e (1743): “have carefully compared the two editions, and\nam very well satisfied, upon that comparison, that the larger are an\ninterpolation of the smaller, and not the smaller an epitome or\nabridgment of the larger. … But whether the smaller themselves are\nthe genuine writings of Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, is a question that\nhas been much disputed, and has employed the pens of the ablest critics.\nAnd whatever positiveness some may have shown on either side, I must own\nI have found it a very difficult question.” (1743): “have carefully compared the two editions, and\nam very well satisfied, upon that comparison, that the larger are an\ninterpolation of the smaller, and not the smaller an epitome or\nabridgment of the larger. … But whether the smaller themselves are\nthe genuine writings of Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, is a question that\nhas been much disputed, and has employed the pens of the ablest critics.\nAnd whatever positiveness some may have shown on either side, I must own\nI have found it a very difficult question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v.i-p17\"\u003eThis expression of uncertainty was repeated in\nsubstance by Jortin (1751), Mosheim (1755), Griesbach (1768), Rosenmüller\n(1795), Neander (1826), and many others; some going so far as to deny\nthat we have any authentic remains of Ignatius at all, while others,\nthough admitting the seven shorter letters as being probably his, yet\nstrongly suspected that they were not free from interpolation. Upon the\nwhole, however, the shorter recension was, until recently, accepted\nwithout much opposition, and chiefly in dependence on the work of Bishop\nPearson above mentioned, as exhibiting the genuine form of the Epistles\nof Ignatius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v.i-p18\"\u003eBut a totally different aspect was given to the\nquestion by the discovery of a Syriac version of three of these Epistles\namong the \u003cspan class=\"sc\" id=\"v.i-p18.1\"\u003emss.\u003c/span\u003e procured\nfrom the monastery of St. Mary Deipara, in the desert of Nitria, in\nEgypt.

But as for\nme, I do not place my hopes in one who died for me in appearance, but in\nreality. For that which is false is quite abhorrent to the truth. Mary then did truly conceive a body which had God\ninhabiting it. And God the Word was truly born of the Virgin, having\nclothed Himself with a body of like passions with our own. He who forms\nall men in the womb, was Himself really in the womb, and made for Himself\na body of the seed of the Virgin, but without any intercourse of man. He\nwas carried in the womb, even as we are, for the usual period of time;\nand was really born, as we also are; and was in reality nourished with\nmilk, and partook of common meat and drink, even as we do. And when He\nhad lived among men for thirty years, He was baptized by John, really and\nnot in appearance; and when He had preached the Gospel three years, and\ndone signs and wonders, He who was Himself the Judge was judged by the\nJews, falsely so called, and by Pilate the governor; was scourged, was\nsmitten on the cheek, was spit upon; He wore a crown of thorns and a\npurple robe; He was condemned: He was crucified in reality, and not in\nappearance, not in imagination, not in deceit. He really died, and was buried, and rose from\nthe dead, even as He prayed in a certain place, saying, “But do\nThou, O Lord, raise me up again, and I shall recompense them.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"802\"\u003e802\u003c/sup\u003e And the Father, who always hears Him,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"803\"\u003e803\u003c/sup\u003e answered and said, “Arise, O God, and\njudge the earth; for Thou shall receive all the heathen for Thine\ninheritance.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"804\"\u003e804\u003c/sup\u003e The Father, therefore,\nwho raised Him up, will also raise us up through Him, apart from whom no\none will attain to true life.

And some have conceived that the writer who gave forth to the\nworld the Apostolic Constitutions under the name of Clement, was probably\nthe author of these letters falsely ascribed to Ignatius, as well as of\nthe longer recension of the seven Epistles which are mentioned by\nEusebius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v.xiii-p5\"\u003eIt was a considerable time before editors in modern\ntimes began to discriminate between the true and the false in the\nwritings attributed to Ignatius. The letters first published under his\nname were those three which exist only in Latin. These came forth in 1495\nat Paris, being appended to a life of Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nSome three years later, eleven Epistles, comprising those mentioned by\nEusebius, and four others, were published in Latin, and passed through\nfour or five editions. In 1536, the whole of the professedly Ignatian\nletters were published at Cologne in a Latin version; and this collection\nalso passed through several editions. It was not till 1557 that the\nIgnatian Epistles appeared for the first time in Greek at Dillingen.\nAfter this date many editions came forth, in which the probably genuine\nwere still mixed up with the certainly spurious, the three Latin letters,\nonly being rejected as destitute of authority. Vedelius of Geneva first\nmade the distinction which is now universally accepted, in an edition of\nthese Epistles which he published in 1623; and he was followed by\nArchbishop Usher and others, who entered more fully into that critical\nexamination of these writings which has been continued down even to our\nown day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v.xiii-p6\"\u003eThe reader will have no difficulty in detecting the\ninternal grounds on which these eight letters\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_106.html\" id=\"v.xiii-Page_106\" n=\"106\" /\u003e\n\nare set aside\nas spurious.

In the\nEpistle to the Antiochians there is an enumeration of various Church\nofficers, who were certainly unknown at the period when Ignatius lived.\nThe Epistle to Hero plainly alludes to Manichæan errors, and could not\ntherefore have been written before the third century.

Its comparative simplicity, too, is greatly\nin its favour. It makes no reference to the legends which by and by\nconnected themselves with the name of Ignatius.
