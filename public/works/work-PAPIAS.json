Our notice of these circumstances may not be\nwithout its use. It may also be worth while to add to the statements of\nPapias already given, other passages of his in which he relates some\nmiraculous deeds, stating that he acquired the knowledge of them from\ntradition. The residence of the Apostle Philip with his daughters in\nHierapolis has been mentioned above. We must now point out how Papias,\nwho lived at the same time, relates that he had received a wonderful\nnarrative from the daughters of Philip. For he relates that a dead man\nwas raised to life in his day.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"1757\"\u003e1757\u003c/sup\u003e He also mentions another miracle relating to\nJustus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly poison, and received\nno harm, on account of the grace of the Lord.

He moreover\nhands down, in his own writing, other narratives given by the previously\nmentioned Aristion of the Lord’s sayings, and the traditions of the\npresbyter John. For\ninformation on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books\nthemselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as being\na matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the\nGospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words]: And the\npresbyter said this. Mark having become the\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_155.html\" id=\"vii.ii.vi-Page_155\" n=\"155\" /\u003e\n\ninterpreter of\nPeter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not,\nhowever, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ.\nFor he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I\nsaid, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the\nnecessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular\nnarrative of the Lord’s sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in\nthus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took\nespecial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything\nfictitious into the statements. \n\ninterpreter of\nPeter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered.
