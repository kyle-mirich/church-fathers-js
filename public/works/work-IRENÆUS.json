We cannot\ndoubt that to this visit we owe the lifelong struggle of Irenæus against\nthe heresies that now came in, like locusts, to devour the harvests of\nthe Gospel.

When the emissaries of heresy\nfollowed him, and began to disseminate their licentious practices and\nfoolish doctrines by the aid of “silly women,” the great work\nof his life began. He condescended to study these diseases of the human\nmind like a wise physician; and, sickening as was the process of\nclassifying and describing them, he made this also his laborious task,\nthat he might enable others to withstand and to overcome them. The works\nhe has left us are monuments of his fidelity to Christ, and to the\ncharges of St. Paul, St. Peter, and St. Jude, whose solemn warnings now\nproved to be prophecies.

Thus testimony to\nprimitive truth was secured and recorded: the language of catholic\northodoxy was developed and defined, and landmarks of faith were set up\nfor perpetual memorial to all generations. It is a striking example of\nthis divine economy, that the see of Rome was allowed to exhibit its\nfallibility very conspicuously at this time, and not only to receive the\nrebukes of Irenæus, but to accept them as wholesome and necessary; so\nthat the heresy of Eleutherus, and the spirit of Diotrephes in Victor,\nhave enabled reformers ever since, and even in the darkest days of\npontifical despotism, to testify against the manifold errors patronized\nby Rome. Hilary and other Gallicans have been strengthened by the example\nof Irenæus, and by his faithful words of reproof and exhortation, to\nresist Rome, even down to our own times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.i-p7\"\u003eThat the intolerable absurdities of Gnosticism should\nhave gained so many disciples, and proved itself an adversary to be\ngrappled with and not despised, throws light on the condition of the\nhuman mind under heathenism, even when it professed\n“knowledge” and “philosophy.” The task of\nIrenæus was twofold: (1) to render it impossible for any one to confound\nGnosticism with Christianity, and (2) to make it impossible for such a\nmonstrous system to survive, or ever to rise again. His task was a\nnauseous one; but never was the spirit enjoined by Scripture more\npatiently exhibited, nor with more entire success.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2652\"\u003e2652\u003c/sup\u003e If Julian had found Gnosticism just made to\nhis hand, and powerful enough to suit his purposes, the whole history of\nhis attempt to revive Paganism would have been widely different.

If the fog and malaria that rose with the\nDay-star, and obscured it, were speedily dispersed, our author is largely\nto be identified with the radiance which flowed from the Sun of\nrighteousness, and with the breath of the Spirit that banished them for\never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.i-p9\"\u003eThe Episcopate of Irenæus was distinguished by\nlabours, “in season and out of season,” for the\nevangelization of Southern Gaul; and he seems to have sent missionaries\ninto other regions of what we now call France.

The first of these contains a minute description of\nthe tenets of the various heretical sects, with occasional brief remarks\nin illustration of their absurdity, and in confirmation of the truth to\nwhich they were opposed. In his second book, Irenæus proceeds to a more\ncomplete demolition of those heresies which he has already explained, and\nargues at great length against them, on grounds principally of reason.\nThe three remaining books set forth more directly the true doctrines of\nrevelation, as being in utter antagonism to the views held by the Gnostic\nteachers. In the course of this argument, many passages of Scripture are\nquoted and commented on; many interesting statements are made, bearing on\nthe rule of faith; and much important light is shed on the doctrines,\nheld, as well as the practices observed, by the Church of the second\ncentury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.i-p15\"\u003eIt may be made matter of regret, that so large a\nportion of the work of Irenæus is given to an exposition of the manifold\nGnostic speculations. Nothing more absurd than these has probably ever\nbeen imagined by rational beings. Some ingenious and learned men have\nindeed endeavoured to reconcile the wild theories of these heretics with\nthe principles of reason; but, as Bishop Kaye remarks (\u003ci\u003eEccl. Hist. of\nthe Second and Third Centuries\u003c/i\u003e, p. 524), “a more arduous or\nunpromising undertaking cannot well be conceived.” The fundamental\nobject of the Gnostic speculations was doubtless to solve the two grand\nproblems of all religious philosophy, viz., How to account for the\nexistence of evil; and, How to reconcile the finite with the infinite.\nBut these ancient theorists were not more successful in grappling with\nsuch questions than have been their successors in modern times.

This is\nespecially felt in the perusal of the first two books, which, as has been\nsaid, are principally devoted to an exposition and subversion of the\nvarious heretical systems. But the vagaries of the human mind, however\nmelancholy in themselves, are never altogether destitute of instruction.\nAnd in dealing with those set before us in this work, we have not only\nthe satisfaction of becoming acquainted with the currents of thought\nprevalent in these early times, but we obtain much valuable information\nregarding the primitive Church, which, had it not been for these\nheretical schemes, might never have reached our day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.i-p17\"\u003eNot a little of what is contained in the following\npages will seem almost unintelligible to the English reader.

But we have not thought it worth while to devote a\ngreat deal of space to the elucidation of those obscure Gnostic views\nwhich, in so many varying forms, are set forth in this work. For the same\nreason, we give here no account of the origin, history, and successive\nphases of Gnosticism.

Irenæus, even in the\noriginal Greek, is often a very obscure writer. At times he expresses\nhimself with remarkable clearness and terseness; but, upon the whole, his\nstyle is very involved and prolix. And the Latin version adds to these\ndifficulties of the original, by being itself of the most barbarous\ncharacter. In fact, it is often necessary to make a conjectural\nre-translation of it into Greek, in order to obtain some inkling of what\nthe author wrote. Dodwell supposes this Latin version to have been made\nabout the end of the fourth century; but as Tertullian seems to have used\nit, we must rather place it in the beginning of the third. Its author is\nunknown, but he was certainly little qualified for his task. We have\nendeavoured to give as close and accurate a translation of the work as\npossible, but there are not a few passages in which a guess can only be\nmade as to the probable meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.i-p20\"\u003eIrenæus had manifestly taken great pains to make\nhimself acquainted with the various heretical systems which he describes.\nHis mode of exposing and refuting these is generally very effective. It\nis plain that he possessed a good share of learning, and that he had a\nfirm grasp of the doctrines of Scripture. Not unfrequently he indulges in\na kind of sarcastic humour, while inveighing against the folly and\nimpiety of the heretics. But at times he gives expression to very strange\nopinions. He is, for example, quite peculiar in imagining that our Lord\nlived to be an \u003ci\u003eold\u003c/i\u003e man, and that His public ministry embraced at\nleast  man, and that His public ministry embraced at\nleast \u003ci\u003eten\u003c/i\u003e years.

It has been generally supposed that he was a native\nof Smyrna, or some neighbouring city, in Asia Minor. Harvey, however,\nthinks that he was probably born in Syria, and removed in boyhood to\nSmyrna. He himself tells us (iii. 3, 4) that he was in early youth\nacquainted with Polycarp, the illustrious bishop of that city. A sort of\nclue is thus furnished as to the date of his birth.

All these contained merely the ancient barbarous Latin\nversion, and were deficient towards the end by five entire chapters.\nThese latter were supplied by the edition of Feuardent, Professor of\nDivinity at Paris, which was published in 1575, and went through six\nsubsequent editions. Previously to this, however, another had been set\nforth by Gallasius, a minister of Geneva, which contained the first\nportions of the Greek text from Epiphanius. Then, in 1702, came the\nedition of Grabe, a learned Prussian, who had settled in England. It was\npublished at Oxford, and contained considerable additions to the Greek\ntext, with fragments. Ten years after this there appeared the important\nParis edition by the Benedictine monk Massuet. This was reprinted at\nVenice in the year 1724, in two thin folio volumes, and again at Paris in\na large octavo, by the Abbé Migne, in 1857. A German edition was\npublished by Stieren in 1853. In the year 1857 there was also brought out\na Cambridge edition, by the Rev. Wigan Harvey, in two octavo volumes. The\ntwo principal features of this edition are: the additions which have been\nmade to the Greek text from the recently discovered\n\u003ci\u003ePhilosophoumena\u003c/i\u003e of Hippolytus; and the further addition of\nthirty-two fragments of a Syriac version of the Greek text of Irenæus,\nculled from the Nitrian collection of Syriac  of Hippolytus; and the further addition of\nthirty-two fragments of a Syriac version of the Greek text of Irenæus,\nculled from the Nitrian collection of Syriac \u003cspan class=\"sc\" id=\"ix.i-p24.1\"\u003emss.\u003c/span\u003e in the British Museum.

They proceed to tell us that the Propator of their\nscheme was known only to Monogenes, who sprang from him; in other\nwords, only to Nous, while to all the others he was invisible and\nincomprehensible. And, according to them, Nous alone took pleasure in\ncontemplating the Father, and exulting in considering his immeasurable\ngreatness; while he also meditated how he might communicate to the rest\nof the Æons the greatness of the Father, revealing to them how vast and\nmighty he was, and how he was without beginning,—beyond\ncomprehension, and altogether incapable of being seen. But, in accordance\nwith the will of the Father, Sige restrained him,\nbecause it was his design to lead them all to an acquaintance with the\naforesaid Propator, and to create within them a desire of investigating\nhis nature. In like manner, the rest of the Æons also, in a kind of\nquiet way, had a wish to behold the Author of their being, and to\ncontemplate that First Cause which had no beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.iii-p2\"\u003e2. But\nthere rushed forth in advance of the rest that Æon who was much the\nlatest of them, and was the youngest of the Duodecad which sprang from\nAnthropos and Ecclesia, namely Sophia, and suffered passion apart from\nthe embrace of her consort Theletos. This passion, indeed, first arose\namong those who were connected with Nous and Aletheia, but passed as by contagion to\nthis degenerate Æon, who acted under a pretence of love, but was in\nreality influenced by temerity, because she had not, like Nous, enjoyed\ncommunion with the perfect Father. This passion, they say, consisted in a\ndesire to search into the nature of the Father; for she wished, according\nto them, to comprehend his greatness. When she could not attain her end,\ninasmuch as she aimed at an impossibility, and thus became involved in an\nextreme agony of mind, while both on account of the vast profundity as\nwell as the unsearchable nature of the Father, and on account of the love\nshe bore him, she was ever stretching herself forward, there was danger\nlest she should at last have been absorbed by his sweetness, and resolved\ninto his absolute essence, unless she had met with that Power which\nsupports all things, and preserves them outside of the unspeakable\ngreatness. This power they term Horos; by whom, they say, she was\nrestrained and supported; and that then, having with difficulty been\nbrought back to herself, she was convinced that the Father is\nincomprehensible, and so laid aside her original design, along with that\npassion which had arisen within her from the overwhelming influence of\nher admiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.iii-p3\"\u003e3.

Being greatly\nharassed by these passions, she at last changed her mind, and endeavoured\nto return anew to the Father. When, however, she in some measure made the\nattempt, strength failed her, and she became a suppliant of the Father.\nThe other Æons, Nous in particular, presented their supplications along\nwith her.

For they maintain that sometimes the Father acts in\nconjunction with Sige, but that at other times he shows himself\nindependent both of male and female. They term this Horos both Stauros\nand Lytrotes, and Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2674\"\u003e2674\u003c/sup\u003e And by this Horos\nthey declare that Sophia was purified and established, while she was also\nrestored to her proper conjunction. For her enthymesis (or\ninborn idea) having been taken away from her, along with its supervening\npassion, she herself certainly remained within the Pleroma; but her\nenthymesis, with its passion, was separated from her by Horos,\nfenced\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2675\"\u003e2675\u003c/sup\u003e off, and expelled from that circle.\nThis enthymesis was, no doubt, a spiritual substance, possessing some of\nthe natural tendencies of an Æon, but at the same time shapeless and\nwithout form, because it had received nothing.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2676\"\u003e2676\u003c/sup\u003e And on this\naccount they say that it was an imbecile and feminine production.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2677\"\u003e2677\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.iii-p13\"\u003e5. After this substance had been placed outside of the\nPleroma of the Æons, and its mother restored to her proper conjunction,\nthey tell us that Monogenes, acting in accordance with the prudent\nforethought of the Father, gave origin to another conjugal pair, namely\nChrist and the Holy Spirit (lest any of the Æons should fall into a\ncalamity similar to that of Sophia), for the purpose of fortifying and\nstrengthening the Pleroma, and who at the same time completed the number\nof the Æons. Christ then instructed them as to the nature of their\nconjunction, and taught them that those who possessed a comprehension of\nthe Unbegotten were sufficient for themselves.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2678\"\u003e2678\u003c/sup\u003e He also announced among them what\nrelated to the knowledge of the Father,—namely, that he cannot be\nunderstood or comprehended, nor so much as seen or heard, except in so\nfar as he is known by Monogenes only. And the reason why the rest of the\nÆons possess perpetual existence is found in that part of the\nFather’s nature which is incomprehensible; but the reason of their\norigin and formation was situated in that which may be comprehended\nregarding him, that is, in the Son.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2679\"\u003e2679\u003c/sup\u003e Christ, then, who had just been produced, effected\nthese things among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.iii-p16\"\u003e6. But the Holy Spirit\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2680\"\u003e2680\u003c/sup\u003e taught them to\ngive thanks on being all rendered equal among themselves, and led them to\na state of true repose. Thus, then, they tell us that the Æons were\nconstituted equal to each other in form and sentiment, so that all became\nas Nous, and Logos, and Anthropos, and Christus. The female Æons, too,\nbecame all as Aletheia, and Zoe, and Spiritus, and Ecclesia. Everything,\nthen, being thus established, and brought into a state of perfect rest,\nthey next tell us that these beings sang praises with great joy to the\nPropator, who himself shared in the abounding exaltation. Then, out of\ngratitude for the great benefit which had been conferred on them, the\nwhole Pleroma of the Æons, with one design and desire, and with the\nconcurrence of Christ and the Holy Spirit, their Father also setting the\nseal of His approval on their conduct, brought together whatever each one\nhad in himself of the greatest beauty and preciousness; and uniting all\nthese contributions so as skilfully to blend the whole, they produced, to\nthe honour and glory of Bythus, a being of most perfect beauty, the very\nstar of the Pleroma, and the perfect fruit [of it], namely Jesus. Him\nthey also speak of under the name of Saviour, and Christ, and\npatronymically, Logos, and Everything, because He was formed from the\ncontributions of all. And then we are told that, by way of honour, angels\nof the same nature as Himself were simultaneously produced, to act as His\nbody-guard.\u003c/p\u003e",

They then represent the Saviour as having indicated this\ntwofold faculty: first, the sustaining power, when He said,\n“Whosoever doth not bear his cross (Stauros), and follow after me,\ncannot be my disciple;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2702\"\u003e2702\u003c/sup\u003e and again, “Taking up the cross, follow\nme;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2703\"\u003e2703\u003c/sup\u003e but the separating power\nwhen He said, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2704\"\u003e2704\u003c/sup\u003e They also maintain that John indicated the\nsame thing when he said, “The fan is in His hand, and He will\nthoroughly purge the floor, and will gather the wheat into His garner;\nbut the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2705\"\u003e2705\u003c/sup\u003e By this declaration He set forth the faculty\nof Horos.

Moreover, they affirm that\nthe Apostle Paul himself made mention of this cross in the following\nwords: “The doctrine of the cross is to them that perish\nfoolishness, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2707\"\u003e2707\u003c/sup\u003e And again: “God forbid that I should\nglory in anything\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2708\"\u003e2708\u003c/sup\u003e save in the cross of Christ, by whom the\nworld is crucified to me, and I unto the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.iv-p34\"\u003e6.

Wherefore also she is called by two names—Sophia\nafter her father (for Sophia is spoken of as being her father), and Holy\nSpirit from that Spirit who is along with Christ.

This collection [of\npassions] they declare was the substance of the matter from which this\nworld was formed.

All other things owed their beginning to her\nterror and sorrow. For from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was\nformed; from her smile all that is lucent; and from her grief and\nperplexity all the corporeal elements of the world. For at one time, as\nthey affirm, she would weep and lament on account of being left alone in\nthe midst of darkness and vacuity; while, at another time, reflecting on\nthe light which had forsaken her, she would be filled with joy, and\nlaugh; then, again, she would be struck with terror; or, at other times,\nwould sink into consternation and bewilderment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.v-p11\"\u003e3. Now what follows from all this? No light tragedy\ncomes out of it, as the fancy of every man among them pompously explains,\none in one way, and another in another, from what kind of passion and\nfrom what element being derived its origin. They have good reason, as\nseems to me, why they should not feel inclined to teach these things to\nall in public, but only to such as are able to pay a high price for an\nacquaintance with such profound mysteries. For these doctrines are not at\nall similar to those of which our Lord said, “Freely ye have\nreceived, freely give.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2719\"\u003e2719\u003c/sup\u003e They are,\non the contrary, abstruse, and portentous, and profound mysteries, to be\ngot at only with great labour by such as are in love with falsehood. For\nwho would not expend all that he possessed, if only he might learn in\nreturn, that from the tears of the enthymesis of the Æon involved in\npassion, seas, and fountains, and rivers, and every liquid substance\nderived its origin; that light burst forth from her smile; and that from\nher perplexity and consternation the corporeal elements of the world had\ntheir formation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.v-p13\"\u003e4. I feel somewhat inclined myself to contribute a few\nhints towards the development of their system. For when I perceive that\nwaters are in part fresh, such as fountains, rivers, showers, and so on,\nand in part salt; such as those in the sea, I reflect with myself that\nall such waters cannot be derived from her tears, inasmuch as these are\nof a saline quality only. It is clear, therefore, that the waters which\nare salt are alone those which are derived from her tears. But it is\nprobable that she, in her intense agony and perplexity, was covered with\nperspiration. And hence, following out their notion, we may conceive that\nfountains and rivers, and all the fresh water in the world, are due to\nthis source. For it is difficult, since we know that all tears are of the\nsame quality, to believe that waters both salt and fresh proceeded from\nthem. The more plausible supposition is, that some are from her tears,\nand some from her perspiration. And since there are also in the world\ncertain waters which are hot and acrid in their nature, thou must be left\nto guess their origin, how and whence. Such are some of the results of\ntheir hypothesis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.v-p14\"\u003e5. They go on to state that, when the mother Achamoth\nhad passed through all sorts of passion, and had with difficulty escaped\nfrom them, she turned herself to supplicate the light which had forsaken\nher, that is, Christ. He, however, having returned to the Pleroma, and\nbeing probably unwilling again to descend from it, sent forth to her the\nParaclete, that is, the Saviour.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2720\"\u003e2720\u003c/sup\u003e This\nbeing was endowed with all power by the Father, who placed everything\nunder his authority, the Æons\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2721\"\u003e2721\u003c/sup\u003e doing so likewise, so\nthat “by him were all things, visible and invisible, created,\nthrones, divinities, dominions.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2722\"\u003e2722\u003c/sup\u003e He then was\nsent to her along with his contemporary angels. And they related that\nAchamoth, filled with reverence, at first veiled herself through modesty,\nbut that by and by, when she had looked upon him with all his endowments,\nand had acquired strength from his appearance, she ran forward to meet\nhim. He then imparted to her form as respected intelligence, and brought\nhealing to her passions, separating them from her, but not\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_322.html\" id=\"ix.ii.v-Page_322\" n=\"322\" /\u003e\n\nso as to drive them out of thought altogether.

All\nthat he could do was to separate them and set them apart, and then\ncommingle and condense them, so as to transmute them from incorporeal\npassion into unorganized matter.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2724\"\u003e2724\u003c/sup\u003e He then by this process conferred upon them\na fitness and a nature to become concretions and corporeal structures, in\norder that two substances should be formed,—the one evil,\nresulting from the passions, and the other subject indeed to suffering,\nbut originating from her conversion.

But when Achamoth was freed from her passion,\nshe gazed with rapture on the dazzling vision of the angels that were\nwith him; and in her ecstasy, conceiving by them, they tell us that she\nbrought forth new beings, partly after her own image, and partly a\nspiritual progeny after the image of the Saviour’s attendants.\u003c/p\u003e",

But she could not succeed in doing this as respected the spiritual\nexistence, because it was of the same nature with herself.

As,\nthen, they represent all material substance to be formed from three\npassions, viz., fear, grief, and perplexity, the account they give is as\nfollows: Animal\nsubstances originated from fear and from conversion; the Demiurge they\nalso describe as owing his origin to conversion; but the existence of all\nthe other animal substances they ascribe to fear, such as the souls of\nirrational animals, and of wild beasts, and men. And on this account, he\n(the Demiurge), being incapable of recognising any spiritual essences,\nimagined himself to be God alone, and declared through the prophets,\n“I am God, and besides me there is none else.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2732\"\u003e2732\u003c/sup\u003e They\nfurther teach that the spirits of wickedness derived their origin from\ngrief. Hence the devil, whom they\nalso call Cosmocrator (the ruler of the world), and the demons, and the\nangels, and every wicked spiritual being that exists, found the source of\ntheir existence. They represent the Demiurge as being the son of that\nmother of theirs (Achamoth), and Cosmocrator as the creature of the\nDemiurge. Cosmocrator has knowledge of what is above himself, because he\nis a \u003ci\u003espirit\u003c/i\u003e of wickedness; but the Demiurge is ignorant of such\nthings, inasmuch as he is merely  of wickedness; but the Demiurge is ignorant of such\nthings, inasmuch as he is merely \u003ci\u003eanimal\u003c/i\u003e.

It\nwas this latter which was created after his image and likeness. The\nmaterial part, indeed, was very near to God, so far as the image went,\nbut not of the same substance with him. The animal, on the other hand,\nwas so in respect to likeness; and hence his substance was called the\nspirit of life, because it took its rise from a spiritual outflowing.\nAfter all this, he was, they say, enveloped all round with a covering of\nskin; and by this they mean the outward sensitive flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.vi-p13\"\u003e6. But\nthey further affirm that the Demiurge himself was ignorant of that\noffspring of his mother Achamoth, which she brought forth as a\nconsequence of her contemplation of those angels who waited on the\nSaviour, and which was, like herself, of a spiritual nature. She took\nadvantage of this ignorance to deposit it (her production) in him without\nhis knowledge, in order that, being by his instrumentality infused into\nthat animal soul proceeding from himself, and being thus carried as in a\nwomb in this material body, while it gradually increased in strength,\nmight in course of time become fitted for the reception of perfect\nrationality.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2733\"\u003e2733\u003c/sup\u003e\nThus it came to pass, then, according to them, that, without any\nknowledge on the part of the Demiurge, the man formed by his inspiration\nwas at the same time, through an unspeakable providence, rendered a\nspiritual man by the simultaneous inspiration received from Sophia.

For even as gold, when submersed in filth, loses not on that\naccount its beauty, but retains its own native qualities, the filth\nhaving no power to injure the gold, so they affirm that they cannot in\nany measure suffer hurt, or lose their spiritual substance, whatever the\nmaterial actions in which they may be involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.vii-p7\"\u003e3.

Others of them yield themselves up to the lusts of\nthe flesh with the utmost greediness, maintaining that carnal things\nshould be allowed to the carnal nature, while spiritual things are\nprovided for the spiritual. Some of them, moreover, are in the habit of\ndefiling those women to whom they have taught the above doctrine, as has\nfrequently been confessed by those women who have been led astray by\ncertain of them, on their returning to the Church of God, and\nacknowledging this along with the rest of their errors.

They\nhold, accordingly, that our Lord, while preserving the type of the\nfirst-begotten and primary tetrad, was compounded of these four\nsubstances,—of that which is spiritual, in so far as He was from\nAchamoth; of that which is animal, as being from the Demiurge by a\nspecial dispensation, inasmuch as He was formed [corporeally] with\nunspeakable skill; and of the Saviour, as respects that dove which\ndescended upon Him.

The\nmaterial goes, as a matter of course, into corruption. The animal, if it\nmake choice of the better part, finds repose in the intermediate place;\nbut if the worse, it too shall pass into destruction. But they assert\nthat the spiritual principles which have been sown by Achamoth, being\ndisciplined and nourished here from that time until now in righteous\nsouls (because when given forth by her they were yet but weak), at last\nattaining to perfection, shall be given as brides to the angels of the\nSaviour, while their animal souls of necessity rest for ever with the\nDemiurge in the intermediate place. And again subdividing the animal\nsouls themselves, they say that some are by nature good, and others by\nnature evil. The good are those who become capable of receiving the\n[spiritual] seed; the evil by nature are those who are never able to\nreceive that seed.\u003c/p\u003e",

Further, they teach that\nJohn, the disciple of the Lord, indicated the first Ogdoad, expressing\nthemselves in these words: John, the disciple of the Lord, wishing to set\nforth the origin of all things, so as to explain how the Father produced\nthe whole, lays down a certain principle,—that, namely, which was\nfirst-begotten by God, which Being he has termed both the only-begotten\nSon and God, in whom the Father, after a seminal manner, brought forth\nall things. By him the Word was produced, and in him the whole substance\nof the Æons, to which the Word himself afterwards imparted form. Since,\ntherefore, he treats of the first origin of things, he rightly proceeds\nin his teaching from the beginning, that is, from God and the Word. And\nhe expresses himself thus: “In the beginning was the Word, and the\nWord was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning\nwith God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2772\"\u003e2772\u003c/sup\u003e Having first of all\ndistinguished these three—God, the Beginning, and the Word\n—he again unites them, that he may exhibit the production of each\nof them, that is, of the Son and of the Word, and may at the same time\nshow their union with one another, and with the Father. For “the\nbeginning” is in the Father, and of the Father, while “the\nWord” is in the beginning, and of the beginning. Very properly,\nthen, did he say, “In the beginning was the Word,” for He was\nin the Son; “and the Word was with God,” for He was the\nbeginning; “and the Word was God,” of course, for that which\nis begotten of God is God. “The same was in the beginning with\nGod”—this clause discloses the order of production.\n“All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing\nmade;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2773\"\u003e2773\u003c/sup\u003e for the Word was the author\nof form and beginning to all the Æons that came into existence after\nHim. But “what was made in Him,” says John, “is\nlife.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2774\"\u003e2774\u003c/sup\u003e Here again he\nindicated conjunction; for all things, he said, were made \u003ci\u003eby\u003c/i\u003e Him,\nbut  Him,\nbut \u003ci\u003ein\u003c/i\u003e Him was life. This, then, which is in Him, is more closely\nconnected with Him than those things which were simply made by Him, for\nit exists along with Him, and is developed by Him. When, again, he adds,\n“And the life was the light of men,” while thus mentioning\nAnthropos, he indicated also Ecclesia by that one expression, in order\nthat, by using only one name, he might disclose their fellowship with one\nanother, in virtue of their conjunction. For Anthropos and Ecclesia\nspring from Logos and Zoe. Moreover, he styled life (Zoe) the light of\nmen, because they are enlightened by her, that is, formed and made\nmanifest. This also Paul declares in these words: “For whatsoever\ndoth make manifest is light.” Him was life. This, then, which is in Him, is more closely\nconnected with Him than those things which were simply made by Him, for\nit exists along with Him, and is developed by Him. When, again, he adds,\n“And the life was the light of men,” while thus mentioning\nAnthropos, he indicated also Ecclesia by that one expression, in order\nthat, by using only one name, he might disclose their fellowship with one\nanother, in virtue of their conjunction.

Thus, then, did John by these words reveal both other\nthings and the second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia. And\nstill further, he also indicated the first Tetrad. For, in discoursing of\nthe Saviour and declaring that all things beyond the Pleroma received\nform from Him, he says that He is the fruit of the entire Pleroma. For he\nstyles Him a “light which shineth in darkness, and which was not\ncomprehended”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2776\"\u003e2776\u003c/sup\u003e by it, inasmuch as, when He\nimparted form to all those things which had their origin from passion, He\nwas not known by it.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2777\"\u003e2777\u003c/sup\u003e He also styles Him Son, and Aletheia, and Zoe, and the\n“Word made flesh, whose glory,” he says, “we beheld;\nand His glory was as that of the Only-begotten (given to Him by the\nFather), full of grace and truth.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2778\"\u003e2778\u003c/sup\u003e (But\nwhat John really does\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_329.html\" id=\"ix.ii.ix-Page_329\" n=\"329\" /\u003e\n\nsay is this: “And the Word was\nmade flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of\nthe only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”\n\nsay is this: “And the Word was\nmade flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of\nthe only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2779\"\u003e2779\u003c/sup\u003e) Thus, then, does he [according to them] distinctly\nset forth the first Tetrad, when he speaks of the Father, and Charis, and\nMonogenes, and Aletheia.

You\nsee, my friend, the method which these men employ to deceive themselves,\nwhile they abuse the Scriptures by endeavouring to support their own\nsystem out of them. For this reason, I have brought forward their modes\nof expressing themselves, that thus thou mightest understand the\ndeceitfulness of their procedure, and the wickedness of their error. For,\nin the first place, if it had been John’s intention to set forth\nthat Ogdoad above, he would surely have preserved the order of its\nproduction, and would doubtless have placed the primary Tetrad first as\nbeing, according to them, most venerable and would then have annexed the\nsecond, that, by the sequence of the names, the order of the Ogdoad might\nbe exhibited, and not after so long an interval, as if forgetful for the\nmoment and then again calling the matter to mind, he, last of all, made\nmention of the primary Tetrad. In the next place, if he had meant to\nindicate their conjunctions, he certainly would not have omitted the name\nof Ecclesia; while, with respect to the other conjunctions, he either\nwould have been satisfied with the mention of the male [Æons] (since the\nothers [like Ecclesia] might be understood), so as to preserve a\nuniformity throughout; or if he enumerated the conjunctions of the rest,\nhe would also have announced the spouse of Anthropos, and would not have\nleft us to find out her name by divination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.x-p2\"\u003e2. The fallacy, then, of this exposition is manifest.\nFor when John, proclaiming one God, the Almighty, and one Jesus Christ,\nthe Only-begotten, by whom all things were made, declares that this was\nthe Son of God, this the Only-begotten, this the Former of all things,\nthis the true Light who enlighteneth every man, this the Creator of the\nworld, this He that came to His own, this He that became flesh and dwelt\namong us,—these men, by a plausible kind of exposition,\nperverting these statements, maintain that there was another Monogenes,\naccording to production, whom they also style Arche. They also maintain\nthat there was another Saviour, and another Logos, the son of Monogenes,\nand another Christ produced for the re-establishment of the Pleroma. Thus\nit is that, wresting from the truth every one of the expressions which\nhave been cited, and taking a bad advantage of the names, they have\ntransferred them to their own system; so that, according to them, in all\nthese terms John makes no mention of the Lord Jesus Christ. For if he has\nnamed the Father, and Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia, and Logos, and\nZoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia, according to their hypothesis, he has,\nby thus speaking, referred to the primary Ogdoad, in which there was as\nyet no Jesus, and no Christ, the teacher of John. But that the apostle\ndid not speak concerning their conjunctions, but concerning our Lord\nJesus Christ, whom he also acknowledges as the Word of God, he himself\nhas made evident. For, summing up his statements respecting the Word\npreviously mentioned by him, he further declares, “And the Word was\nmade flesh, and dwelt among us.” But, according to their\nhypothesis, the Word did not become flesh at all, inasmuch as He never\nwent outside of the Pleroma, but that Saviour [became flesh] who was\nformed by a special dispensation [out of all the Æons], and was of later\ndate than the Word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.x-p3\"\u003e3. Learn then, ye foolish men, that Jesus who suffered\nfor us, and who dwelt among us, is Himself the Word of God. For if any\nother of the Æons had become flesh for our salvation, it would have been\nprobable that the apostle spoke of another. But if the Word of the Father\nwho descended is the same also that ascended, He, namely, the\nOnly-begotten Son of the only God, who, according to the good pleasure of\nthe Father, became flesh for the sake of men, the apostle certainly does\nnot speak regarding any other, or concerning any Ogdoad, but respecting\nour Lord Jesus Christ. For, according to them, the Word did not\noriginally become flesh. For they maintain that the Saviour assumed an\nanimal body, formed in accordance with a special dispensation by an\nunspeakable providence, so as to become visible and palpable. But\n\u003ci\u003eflesh\u003c/i\u003e is that which was of old formed for Adam by God out of the\ndust, and it is this that John has declared the Word of God became. Thus\nis their primary and first-begotten Ogdoad brought to nought. For, since\nLogos, and Monogenes, and Zoe, and Phōs, and Soter, and Christus,\nand the Son of God, and He who became incarnate for us, have been proved\nto be one and the same, the Ogdoad which they have built up at once falls\nto pieces.

But from\nAnthropos and Ecclesia proceeded twelve, one of which separating from the\nrest, and falling from its original condition, produced the rest\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2800\"\u003e2800\u003c/sup\u003e of the universe. He also supposed two beings of the\nname of Horos, the one of whom has his place between Bythus and the rest\nof the Pleroma, and divides the created Æons from the uncreated Father,\nwhile the other separates their mother from the Pleroma. Christ also was\nnot produced from the Æons within the Pleroma, but was brought forth by\nthe mother who had been excluded from it, in virtue of her remembrance of\nbetter things, but not without a kind of shadow. He, indeed, as being\nmasculine, having severed the shadow from himself, returned to the\nPleroma; but his mother being left with the shadow, and deprived of her\nspiritual substance, brought forth another son, namely, the Demiurge,\nwhom he also styles the supreme ruler of all those things which are\nsubject to him. He also asserts that, along with the Demiurge, there was\nproduced a left-hand power, in which particular he agrees with those\nfalsely called Gnostics, of whom to we have yet to speak. Sometimes,\nagain, he maintains that Jesus was produced from him who was separated\nfrom their mother, and united to the rest, that is, from Theletus,\nsometimes as springing from him who returned into the Pleroma, that is,\nfrom Christ; and at other times still as derived from Anthropos and\nEcclesia. And he declares that the Holy Spirit was produced by\nAletheia\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2801\"\u003e2801\u003c/sup\u003e for the inspection and\nfructification of the Æons, by entering invisibly into them, and that,\nin this way, the Æons brought forth the plants of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xii-p5\"\u003e2. Secundus again affirms that the primary Ogdoad\nconsists of a right hand and a left hand Tetrad, and teaches that the one\nof these is called light, and the other darkness. But he maintains that\nthe power which separated from the rest, and fell away, did not proceed\ndirectly from the thirty Æons, but from their fruits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xii-p6\"\u003e3. There is another,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2802\"\u003e2802\u003c/sup\u003e who is a renowned teacher among them, and who,\nstruggling to reach something more sublime, and to attain to a kind of\nhigher knowledge, has explained the primary Tetrad as follows: There is [he says] a certain Proarche who existed\nbefore all things, surpassing all thought, speech, and nomenclature, whom\nI call Monotes (unity). Together with this Monotes there exists a power,\nwhich again I term Henotes (oneness). This\nHenotes and Monotes, being one, produced, yet not so as to bring forth\n[apart from themselves, as an emanation] the beginning of all things, an\nintelligent, unbegotten, and invisible being, which beginning language\nterms “Monad.” With this Monad there co-exists a power of the\nsame essence, which again I term Hen (One). These powers then—\nMonotes, and Henotes, and Monas, and Hen—produced the remaining\ncompany of the Æons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xii-p8\"\u003e4. Iu,\nIu! Pheu, Pheu!—for well may we utter these tragic exclamations\nat such a pitch of audacity in the coining of names as he has displayed\nwithout a blush, in devising a nomenclature for his system of falsehood.\nFor when he declares: There is a certain Proarche before all things,\nsurpassing all thought, whom I call Monotes; and again, with this Monotes\nthere co-exists a power which I also call Henotes,—it is most\nmanifest that he confesses the things which have been said to be his own\ninvention, and that he himself has given names to his scheme of things,\nwhich had never been previously suggested by any other. It is manifest\nalso, that he himself is the one who has had sufficient audacity to coin\nthese names; so that, unless \u003ci\u003ehe\u003c/i\u003e had appeared in the world, the\ntruth would still have been destitute of a name.

Others still, however, have called their primary and\nfirst-begotten Ogdoad by the following names: first, Proarche; then Anennoetos;\nthirdly, Arrhetos; and fourthly, Aoratos. Then, from the first, Proarche,\nthere was produced, in the first and fifth place, Arche; from Anennoetos,\nin the second and sixth place, Acataleptos; from Arrhetos, in the third\nand seventh place, Anonomastos; and from Aoratos, in the fourth and\neighth place, Agennetos. This is the Pleroma of the first Ogdoad. They\nmaintain that these powers were anterior to Bythus and Sige, that they\nmay appear more perfect than the perfect, and more knowing than the very\nGnostics! To these persons one may justly exclaim: “O ye trifling\nsophists!” since, even respecting Bythus himself, there are among\nthem many and discordant opinions. For some declare him to be without a\nconsort, and neither male nor female, and, in fact, nothing at all; while\nothers affirm him to be masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature of\na hermaphrodite; others, again, allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus\nmay be formed the first conjunction.\u003c/p\u003e",

Again, handing mixed cups to the women, he bids them consecrate\nthese in his presence. When this has been done, he himself produces\nanother cup of much larger size than that which the deluded woman has\nconsecrated, and pouring from the smaller one consecrated by the woman\ninto that which has been brought forward by himself, he at the same time\npronounces these words: “May that Charis who is before all things,\nand who transcends all knowledge and speech, fill thine inner man, and\nmultiply in thee her own knowledge, by sowing the grain of mustard seed\nin thee as in good soil.” Repeating certain other like words, and\nthus goading on the wretched woman [to madness], he then appears a worker\nof wonders when the large cup is seen to have been filled out of the\nsmall one, so as even to overflow by what has been obtained from it.

He devotes himself especially to women, and\nthose such as are well-bred, and elegantly attired, and of great wealth,\nwhom he frequently seeks to draw after him, by addressing them in such\nseductive words as these: “I am eager to make thee a partaker of my\nCharis, since the Father of all doth continually behold thy angel before\nHis face.

But already some of the most faithful women,\npossessed of the fear of God, and not being deceived (whom, nevertheless,\nhe did his best to seduce like the rest by bidding them prophesy),\nabhorring and execrating him, have withdrawn from such a vile company of\nrevellers. This they have done, as being well aware that the gift of\nprophecy is not conferred on men by Marcus, the magician, but that only\nthose to whom God sends His grace from above possess the\ndivinely-bestowed power of prophesying; and then they speak where and\nwhen God pleases, and not when Marcus orders them to do so. For that\nwhich commands is greater and of higher authority than that which is\ncommanded, inasmuch as the former rules, while the latter is in a state\nof subjection. If, then, Marcus, or any one else, does command,—\nas these are accustomed continually at their feasts to play at drawing\nlots, and [in accordance with the lot] to command one another to\nprophesy, giving forth as oracles what is in harmony with their own\ndesires,—it will follow that he who commands is greater and of\nhigher authority than the prophetic spirit, though he is but a man, which\nis impossible. But such spirits as are commanded by these men, and speak\nwhen they desire it, are earthly and weak, audacious and impudent, sent\nforth by Satan for the seduction and perdition of those who do not hold\nfast that well-compacted faith which they received at first through the\nChurch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xiv-p11\"\u003e5. Moreover, that this Marcus compounds philters and\nlove-potions, in order to insult the persons of some of these women, if\nnot of all, those of them who have returned to the Church of God—\na thing which frequently occurs—have acknowledged, confessing,\ntoo, that they have been defiled by him, and that they were filled with a\nburning passion towards him. A sad example of this occurred in the case\nof a certain Asiatic, one of our deacons, who had received him (Marcus)\ninto his house. His wife, a woman of remarkable beauty, fell a victim\nboth in mind and body to this magician, and, for a long time, travelled\nabout with him. At last, when, with no small difficulty, the brethren had\nconverted her, she spent her whole time in the exercise of public\nconfession,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2819\"\u003e2819\u003c/sup\u003e weeping over and\nlamenting the defilement which she had received from this magician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xiv-p13\"\u003e6.

They proclaim themselves as\nbeing “perfect,” so that no one can be compared to them with\nrespect to the immensity of their knowledge, nor even were you to mention\nPaul or Peter, or any other of the apostles. They assert that they\nthemselves know more than all others, and that they alone have imbibed\nthe greatness of the knowledge of that power which is unspeakable. They\nalso maintain that they have attained to a height above all power, and\nthat therefore they are free in every respect to act as they please,\nhaving no one to fear in anything.

This\nMarcus\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2827\"\u003e2827\u003c/sup\u003e then, declaring that he\nalone was the matrix and receptacle of the Sige of Colorbasus, inasmuch\nas he was only-begotten, has brought to the birth in some such way as\nfollows that which was committed to him of the defective Enthymesis. He\ndeclares that the infinitely exalted Tetrad descended upon him from the\ninvisible and indescribable places in the form of a woman (for the world\ncould not have borne it coming in its male form), and expounded to him\nalone its own nature, and the origin of all things, which it had never\nbefore revealed to any one either of gods or men. This was done in the\nfollowing terms: When first the unoriginated, inconceivable Father, who\nis without material substance,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2828\"\u003e2828\u003c/sup\u003e and is neither male nor female, willed to bring forth that which\nis ineffable to Him, and to endow with form that which is invisible, He\nopened His mouth, and sent forth the Word similar to Himself, who,\nstanding near, showed Him what He Himself was, inasmuch as He had been\nmanifested in the form of that which was invisible. Moreover, the\npronunciation of His name took place as follows:—He spoke the\nfirst word of it, which was the beginning\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2829\"\u003e2829\u003c/sup\u003e [of all the rest],\nand that utterance consisted of four letters. He added the second, and\nthis also consisted of four letters. Next He uttered the third, and this\nagain embraced ten letters. Finally, He pronounced the fourth, which was\ncomposed of twelve letters. Thus took place the enunciation of the whole\nname, consisting of thirty letters, and four distinct utterances. Each of\nthese elements has its own peculiar letters, and character, and\npronunciation, and forms, and images, and there is not one of them that\nperceives the shape of that [utterance] of which it is an element.\nNeither does any one know\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2830\"\u003e2830\u003c/sup\u003e itself, nor is it acquainted with the\npronunciation of its neighbour, but each one imagines that by its own\nutterance it does in fact name the whole. For while every one of them is\na part of the whole, it imagines its own sound to be the whole name, and\ndoes not leave off sounding until, by its own utterance, it has reached\nthe last letter of each of the elements. This teacher declares that the\nrestitution of all things will take place, when all these, mixing into\none letter, shall utter one and the same sound. He imagines that the\nemblem of this utterance is found in \u003ci\u003eAmen\u003c/i\u003e, which we pronounce in\nconcert., which we pronounce in\nconcert.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2831\"\u003e2831\u003c/sup\u003e The diverse sounds (he adds) are\nthose which give form to that Æon who is without material substance and\nunbegotten, and these, again, are the forms which the Lord has called\nangels, who continually behold the face of the Father.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2832\"\u003e2832\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xv-p8\"\u003e2. Those names of the elements which may be told, and\nare common, he has called Æons, and words, and roots, and seeds, and\nfulnesses, and fruits. He asserts that each of these, and all that is\npeculiar to every one of them, is to be understood as contained in the\nname Ecclesia. Of these elements, the last letter of the last one uttered\nits voice, and this sound\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2833\"\u003e2833\u003c/sup\u003e\ngoing forth generated its own elements after the image of the [other]\nelements, by which he affirms, that both the things here below were\narranged into the order they occupy, and those that preceded them were\ncalled into existence. He also maintains that the letter itself, the\nsound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the\nsyllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole,\nbut that the sound remained below as if cast outside. But the element\nitself from which the letter with its special pronunciation descended to\nthat below, he affirms to consist of thirty letters, while each of these\nletters, again, contains other letters in itself, by means of which the\nname of the letter is expressed. And thus, again, others are named by\nother letters, and others still by others, so that the multitude of\nletters swells out into infinitude. You may more clearly understand what\nI mean by the following example:—The word \u003ci\u003eDelta\u003c/i\u003e contains\n\n contains\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_337.html\" id=\"ix.ii.xv-Page_337\" n=\"337\" /\u003e\n\nfive letters, viz., D, E, L, T, A: these letters again, are\nwritten by other letters,\n\nfive letters, viz., D, E, L, T, A: these letters again, are\nwritten by other letters,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2834\"\u003e2834\u003c/sup\u003e and others still by others. If, then, the entire composition of\nthe word Delta [when thus analyzed] runs out into infinitude, letters\ncontinually generating other letters, and following one another in\nconstant succession, how much vaster than that [one] word is the [entire]\nocean of letters! And if even one letter be thus infinite, just consider\nthe immensity of the letters in the entire name; out of which the Sige of\nMarcus has taught us the Propator is composed. For which reason the\nFather, knowing the incomprehensibleness of His own nature, assigned to\nthe elements which He also terms Æons, [the power] of each one uttering\nits own enunciation, because no one of them was capable by itself of\nuttering the whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xv-p11\"\u003e3. Moreover, the Tetrad, explaining\nthese things to him more fully, said:—I wish to show thee Aletheia\n(Truth) herself; for I have brought her down from the dwellings above,\nthat thou mayest see her without a veil, and understand her beauty\n—that thou mayest also hear her speaking, and admire her wisdom.\nBehold, then, her head on high, \u003ci\u003eAlpha\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003eOmega\u003c/i\u003e; her neck,\n; her neck,\n\u003ci\u003eBeta\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003ePsi\u003c/i\u003e; her shoulders with her hands, ; her shoulders with her hands, \u003ci\u003eGamma\u003c/i\u003e\nand \nand \u003ci\u003eChi\u003c/i\u003e; her breast, ; her breast, \u003ci\u003eDelta\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003ePhi\u003c/i\u003e; her diaphragm,\n; her diaphragm,\n\u003ci\u003eEpsilon\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003eUpsilon\u003c/i\u003e; her back, ; her back, \u003ci\u003eZeta\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003eTau\u003c/i\u003e;\nher belly, ;\nher belly, \u003ci\u003eEta\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003eSigma\u003c/i\u003e; her thighs, ; her thighs, \u003ci\u003eTheta\u003c/i\u003e and\n and\n\u003ci\u003eRho\u003c/i\u003e; her knees, ; her knees, \u003ci\u003eIota\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003ePi\u003c/i\u003e; her legs, ; her legs, \u003ci\u003eKappa\u003c/i\u003e\nand \nand \u003ci\u003eOmicron\u003c/i\u003e; her ankles, ; her ankles, \u003ci\u003eLambda\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003eXi\u003c/i\u003e; her feet,\n; her feet,\n\u003ci\u003eMu\u003c/i\u003e and  and \u003ci\u003eNu\u003c/i\u003e.

When she (the Tetrad) had spoken these things,\nAletheia looked at him, opened her mouth, and uttered a word. That word\nwas a name, and the name was this one which we do know and speak of,\nviz., Christ Jesus. When she had uttered this name, she at once relapsed\ninto silence. And as Marcus waited in the expectation that she would say\nsomething more, the Tetrad again came forward and said:—Thou hast\nreckoned as contemptible that word which thou hast heard from the mouth\nof Aletheia. This which thou knowest and seemest to possess, is not an\nancient name. For thou possessest the sound of it merely, whilst thou art\nignorant of its power. For Jesus (\u003cspan class=\"Greek\" id=\"ix.ii.xv-p12.1\" lang=\"EL\"\u003e᾽Ιησοῦς\u003c/span\u003e) is a name\narithmetically) is a name\narithmetically\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2835\"\u003e2835\u003c/sup\u003e\nsymbolical, consisting of six letters, and is known by all those that\nbelong to the called. But that which is among the Æons of the Pleroma\nconsists of many parts, and is of another form and shape, and is known by\nthose [angels] who are joined in affinity with Him, and whose figures\n(mightinesses) are always present with Him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xv-p14\"\u003e5. Know, then, that the four-and-twenty letters which\nyou possess are symbolical emanations of the three powers that contain\nthe entire number of the elements above. For you are to reckon thus\n—that the nine mute\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2836\"\u003e2836\u003c/sup\u003e letters\nare [the images] of Pater and Aletheia, because they are without voice,\nthat is, of such a nature as cannot be uttered or pronounced. But the\nsemi-vowels\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2837\"\u003e2837\u003c/sup\u003e\nrepresent Logos and Zoe, because they are, as it were, midway between the\nconsonants and the vowels, partaking\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2838\"\u003e2838\u003c/sup\u003e of the nature of both. The\nvowels, again, are representative of Anthropos and Ecclesia, inasmuch as\na voice proceeding from Anthropos gave being to them all; for the sound\nof the voice imparted to them form. Thus, then, Logos and Zoe possess\neight [of these letters]; Anthropos and Ecclesia seven; and Pater and\nAletheia nine. But since the number allotted to each was unequal, He who\nexisted in the Father came down, having been specially sent by Him from\nwhom He was separated, for the rectification of what had taken place,\nthat the unity of the Pleromas, being endowed with equality, might\ndevelop in all that one power which flows from all. Thus that division\nwhich had only seven letters, received the power of eight,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2839\"\u003e2839\u003c/sup\u003e and the three sets were\nrendered alike in point of number, all becoming Ogdoads; which three,\nwhen brought together, constitute the number four-and-twenty. The three\nelements, too (which he declares to exist in conjunction with three\npowers,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2840\"\u003e2840\u003c/sup\u003e and thus form the six from which have\nflowed the twenty-four letters), being quadrupled by the word of the\nineffable Tetrad, give rise to the same number with them; and these\nelements he maintains to belong to Him who cannot be named. These, again,\nwere endowed by the three powers with a resemblance to Him who is\ninvisible. And he says that those letters which we call double\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2841\"\u003e2841\u003c/sup\u003e are\nthe images of\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_338.html\" id=\"ix.ii.xv-Page_338\" n=\"338\" /\u003e\n\nthe images of these elements; and if these be\nadded to the four-and-twenty letters, by the force of analogy they form\nthe number thirty.\n\nthe images of these elements; and if these be\nadded to the four-and-twenty letters, by the force of analogy they form\nthe number thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xv-p21\"\u003e6. He asserts that the fruit of this arrangement and\nanalogy has been manifested in the likeness of an image, namely, Him who,\nafter six days, ascended\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2842\"\u003e2842\u003c/sup\u003e into the mountain along with three others, and then became one of\nsix (the sixth),\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2843\"\u003e2843\u003c/sup\u003e in which character He\ndescended and was contained in the Hebdomad, since He was the illustrious\nOgdoad,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2844\"\u003e2844\u003c/sup\u003e and contained in Himself the\nentire number of the elements, which the descent of the dove (who is\nAlpha and Omega) made clearly manifest, when He came to be baptized; for\nthe number of the dove is eight hundred and one.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2845\"\u003e2845\u003c/sup\u003e\nAnd for this reason did Moses declare that man was formed on the sixth\nday; and then, again, according to arrangement, it was on the sixth day,\nwhich is the preparation, that the last man appeared, for the\nregeneration of the first. Of this arrangement, both the beginning and\nthe end were formed at that sixth hour, at which He was nailed to the\ntree. For that perfect being Nous, knowing that the number six had the\npower both of formation and regeneration, declared to the children of\nlight, that regeneration which has been wrought out by Him who appeared\nas the \u003ci\u003eEpisemon\u003c/i\u003e in regard to that number.

I wish also to\nexplain to thee their theory as to the way in which the creation itself\nwas formed through the mother by the Demiurge (as it were without his\nknowledge), after the image of things invisible. They maintain, then,\nthat first of all the four elements, fire, water, earth, and air, were\nproduced after the image of the primary Tetrad above, and that then, we\nadd their operations, viz., heat, cold, dryness, and humidity, an exact\nlikeness of the Ogdoad is presented. They next reckon up ten powers in\nthe following manner:—There are seven globular bodies, which they\nalso call heavens; then that globular body which contains these, which\nalso they name the eighth heaven; and, in addition to these, the sun and\nmoon. These, being ten in number, they declare to be types of the\ninvisible Decad, which proceeded from Logos and Zoe. As to the Duodecad,\nit is indicated by the zodiacal circle, as it is called; for they affirm\nthat the twelve signs do most manifestly shadow forth the Duodecad, the\ndaughter of Anthropos and Ecclesia. And since the highest heaven, beating\nupon the very sphere [of the seventh heaven], has been linked with the\nmost rapid precession of the whole system, as a check, and balancing that\nsystem with its own gravity, so that it completes the cycle from sign to\nsign in thirty years,—they say that this is an image of Horus,\nencircling their thirty-named mother.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2877\"\u003e2877\u003c/sup\u003e And then, again, as the moon travels through her\nallotted space of heaven in thirty days, they hold, that by these days\nshe expresses the number of the thirty Æons. The sun also, who runs\nthrough his orbit in twelve months, and then returns to the same point in\nthe circle, makes the Duodecad manifest by these twelve months; and the\ndays, as being measured by twelve hours, are a type of the invisible\nDuodecad. Moreover, they declare that the hour, which is the twelfth part\nof the day, is composed\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2878\"\u003e2878\u003c/sup\u003e of thirty parts, in\norder to set forth the image of the Triacontad. Also the circumference of\nthe zodiacal circle itself contains three hundred and sixty degrees (for\neach of its signs comprises thirty); and thus also they affirm, that by\nmeans of this circle an image is preserved of that connection which\nexists between the twelve and the thirty. Still further, asserting that\nthe earth is divided into twelve zones, and that in each zone it receives\npower from the heavens, according to the perpendicular [position of the\nsun above it], bringing forth productions corresponding to that power\nwhich sends down its influence upon it, they maintain that this is a most\nevident type of the Duodecad and its offspring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xviii-p4\"\u003e2. In addition to these things, they declare that the\nDemiurge, desiring to imitate the infinitude, and eternity, and\nimmensity, and freedom from all measurement by time of the Ogdoad above,\nbut, as he was the fruit of defect, being unable to express its\npermanence and eternity, had recourse to the expedient of spreading out\nits eternity into times, and seasons, and vast numbers of years,\nimagining, that by the multitude of such times he might imitate its\nimmensity.\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_343.html\" id=\"ix.ii.xviii-Page_343\" n=\"343\" /\u003e\n\nThey declare further, that the truth having\nescaped him, he followed that which was false, and that, for this reason,\nwhen the times are fulfilled, his work shall perish.\n\nThey declare further, that the truth having\nescaped him, he followed that which was false, and that, for this reason,\nwhen the times are fulfilled, his work shall perish.\u003c/p\u003e",

And\nwhile they affirm such things as these concerning the creation, every one\nof them generates something new, day by day, according to his ability;\nfor no one is deemed “perfect,” who does not develop among\nthem some mighty fictions. It is thus necessary, first, to indicate what\nthings they metamorphose [to their own use] out of the prophetical\nwritings, and next, to refute them. Moses, then, they declare, by his mode of\nbeginning the account of the creation, has at the commencement pointed\nout the mother of all things when he says, “In the beginning God\ncreated the heaven and the earth;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2879\"\u003e2879\u003c/sup\u003e for, as they\nmaintain, by naming these four,—God, beginning, heaven, and\nearth,—he set forth their Tetrad.

Then, proceeding to mention the\nDecad, he names light, day, night, the firmament, the evening, the\nmorning, dry land, sea, plants, and, in the tenth place, trees. Thus, by\nmeans of these ten names, he indicated the ten Æons. The power of the\nDuodecad, again, was shadowed forth by him thus:—He names the sun,\nmoon, stars, seasons, years, whales, fishes, reptiles, birds, quadrupeds,\nwild beasts, and after all these, in the twelfth place, man. Thus they\nteach that the Triacontad was spoken of through Moses by the Spirit.\nMoreover, man also, being formed after the image of the power above, had\nin himself that ability which flows from the one source. This ability was\nseated in the region of the brain, from which four faculties proceed,\nafter the image of the Tetrad above, and these are called: the first,\n\u003ci\u003esight\u003c/i\u003e, the second, , the second, \u003ci\u003ehearing\u003c/i\u003e, the third, , the third, \u003ci\u003esmell\u003c/i\u003e, and\nthe fourth,, and\nthe fourth,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2881\"\u003e2881\u003c/sup\u003e\n\u003ci\u003etaste\u003c/i\u003e.

Moreover,\nthey teach that the whole man contains the entire image of the Triacontad\nas follows: In his hands, by means of his fingers, he bears the Decad;\nand in his whole body the Duodecad, inasmuch as his body is divided into\ntwelve members; for they portion that out, as the body of Truth is\ndivided by them—a point of which we have already spoken..

The\nOgdoad, again, was shown as follows:—They affirm that man was\nformed on the eighth day, for sometimes they will have him to have been\nmade on the sixth day, and sometimes on the eighth, unless, perchance,\nthey mean that his earthly part was formed on the sixth day, but his\nfleshly part on the eighth, for these two things are distinguished by\nthem.

Their object in this\nis to show that our Lord announced another Father than the Maker of this\nuniverse, whom, as we said before, they impiously declare to have been\nthe fruit of a defect. For instance, when the prophet Isaiah says,\n“But Israel hath not known Me, and My people have not understood\nMe,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2906\"\u003e2906\u003c/sup\u003e they pervert his words to\nmean ignorance of the invisible Bythus.

For they falsely hold, that the Creator was seen by\nthe prophets.

They\nmaintain that Daniel also set forth the same thing when he begged of the\nangels explanations of the parables, as being himself ignorant of them.\nBut the angel, hiding from him the great mystery of Bythus, said unto\nhim, “Go thy way quickly, Daniel, for these sayings are closed up\nuntil those who have understanding do understand them, and those who are\nwhite be made white.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2910\"\u003e2910\u003c/sup\u003e Moreover, they\nvaunt themselves as being the \u003ci\u003ewhite\u003c/i\u003e and the men of  and the men of \u003ci\u003egood\nunderstanding\u003c/i\u003e..\u003c/p\u003e",

Thus there are as many schemes of “redemption” as\nthere are teachers of these mystical opinions. And when we come to refute\nthem, we shall show in its fitting-place, that this class of men have\nbeen instigated by Satan to a denial of that baptism which is\nregeneration to God, and thus to a renunciation of the whole [Christian]\nfaith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxii-p3\"\u003e2. They maintain that those who have attained to\nperfect knowledge must of necessity be regenerated into that power which\nis above all. For it is otherwise impossible to find admittance within\nthe Pleroma, since this [regeneration] it is which leads them down into\nthe depths of Bythus. For the baptism instituted by the visible Jesus was\nfor the remission of sins, but the redemption brought in by that Christ\nwho descended upon Him, was for perfection; and they allege that the\nformer is animal, but the latter spiritual.

For some of\nthem prepare a nuptial couch, and perform a sort of mystic rite\n(pronouncing certain expressions) with those who are being initiated, and\naffirm that it is a spiritual marriage which is celebrated by them, after\nthe likeness of the conjunctions above. Others, again, lead them to a\nplace where water is, and baptize them, with the utterance of these\nwords, “Into the name of the unknown Father of the universe—\ninto truth, the mother of all things—into Him who descended on\nJesus—into union, and redemption, and communion with the\npowers.” Others still repeat certain Hebrew words, in order the\nmore thoroughly to bewilder those who are being initiated, as follows:\n“Basema, Chamosse, Baœnaora, Mistadia, Ruada, Kousta, Babaphor,\nKalachthei.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2925\"\u003e2925\u003c/sup\u003e The\ninterpretation of these terms runs thus: “I invoke that which is\nabove every power of the Father, which is called light, and good Spirit,\nand life, because Thou hast reigned in the body.” Others, again,\nset forth the redemption thus: The name which is hidden from every deity,\nand dominion, and truth which Jesus of Nazareth was clothed with in the\nlives\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2926\"\u003e2926\u003c/sup\u003e of the light of Christ—of Christ, who\nlives by the Holy Ghost, for the angelic redemption. The name of\nrestitution stands thus: Messia, Uphareg, Namempsœman, Chaldœaur,\nMosomedœa, Acphranœ, Psaua, Jesus Nazaria.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2927\"\u003e2927\u003c/sup\u003e The interpretation of these words is as follows: “I do not\ndivide the Spirit of Christ, neither the heart nor the supercelestial\npower which is merciful; may I enjoy Thy name, O Saviour of truth!”\nSuch are words of the initiators; but he who is initiated, replies,\n“I am established, and I am redeemed; I redeem my soul from this\nage (world), and from all things connected with it in the name of Iao,\nwho redeemed his own soul into redemption in Christ who liveth.”\nThen the bystanders add these words, “Peace be to all on whom this\nname rests.” After this they anoint the initiated person with\nbalsam; for they assert that this unguent is a type of that sweet odour\nwhich is above all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxii-p11\"\u003e4. But there are some of them who assert that it is\nsuperfluous to bring persons to the water, but mixing oil and water\ntogether, they place this mixture on the heads of those who are to be\ninitiated, with the use of some such expressions as we have already\nmentioned. And this they maintain to be the redemption. They, too, are\naccustomed to anoint with balsam. Others, however, reject all these\npractices, and maintain that the mystery of the unspeakable and invisible\npower ought not to be performed by visible and corruptible creatures, nor\nshould that of those [beings] who are inconceivable, and incorporeal, and\nbeyond the reach of sense, [be performed] by such as are the objects of\nsense, and possessed of a body. These hold that the knowledge of the\nunspeakable Greatness is itself perfect redemption. For since both defect\nand passion flowed from ignorance, the whole substance of what was thus\nformed is destroyed by knowledge; and therefore knowledge is the\nredemption of the inner man. This, however, is not of a corporeal nature,\nfor the body is corruptible; nor is it animal, since the animal soul is\nthe fruit of a defect, and is, as it were, the abode of the spirit. The\nredemption must therefore be of a spiritual nature; for they affirm that\nthe inner and spiritual man is redeemed by means of knowledge, and that\nthey, having acquired the knowledge of all things, stand thenceforth in\nneed of nothing else. This, then, is the true redemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxii-p12\"\u003e5. Others still there are who continue to redeem\npersons even up to the moment of death, by placing on their heads oil and\nwater, or the pre-mentioned ointment with water, using at the same time\nthe above-named invocations, that the persons referred to may become\nincapable of being seized or seen by the principalities and powers, and\nthat their inner man may ascend on high in an invisible manner, as if\ntheir body were left among created things in this world, while their soul\nis sent forward to the Demiurge. And they instruct them, on their\nreaching the principalities and powers, to make use of these words:\n“I am a son from the Father—the Father who had a\npre-existence, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I have come to\nbehold all things, both those which belong to myself and others,\nalthough, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to\nAchamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself. For\nI derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I come again to my own\nplace whence I went forth.” And they affirm that, by saying these\nthings, he escapes from the powers. He then advances to the companions of\nthe Demiurge, and thus addresses them:—“I am a vessel more\nprecious than the female who formed you. If your mother is ignorant of\nher own descent, I know myself, and am aware whence I am, and I call upon\nthe incorruptible Sophia, who is in the Father, and is the mother of your\nmother, who has no father, nor any male consort; but a female springing\nfrom a female formed you, while ignorant of her own mother, and imagining\nthat she alone existed; but I call upon her mother.” And they\ndeclare, that when the companions of the Demiurge hear these words, they\nare greatly agitated, and upbraid their origin and the race of their\nmother. But he goes into his own place, having\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_347.html\" id=\"ix.ii.xxii-Page_347\" n=\"347\" /\u003e\n\nthrown [off]\nhis chain, that is, his animal nature.

Now this Simon of Samaria, from whom all sorts of\nheresies derive their origin, formed his sect out of the following\nmaterials:—Having redeemed from\nslavery at Tyre, a city of Phœnicia, a certain woman named Helena, he\nwas in the habit of carrying her about with him, declaring that this\nwoman was the first conception of his mind, the mother of all, by whom,\nin the beginning, he conceived in his mind [the thought] of forming\nangels and archangels. For this Ennœa leaping forth from him, and\ncomprehending the will of her father, descended to the lower regions [of\nspace], and generated angels and powers, by whom also he declared this\nworld was formed. But after she had produced them, she was detained by\nthem through motives of jealousy, because they were unwilling to be\nlooked upon as the progeny of any other being. As to himself, they had no\nknowledge of him whatever; but his Ennœa was detained by those powers\nand angels who had been produced by her. She suffered all kinds of\ncontumely from them, so that she could not return upwards to her father,\nbut was even shut up in a human body, and for ages passed in succession\nfrom one female body to another, as from vessel to vessel. She was, for\nexample, in that Helen on whose account the Trojan war was undertaken;\nfor whose sake also Stesichorus\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2937\"\u003e2937\u003c/sup\u003e was struck\nblind, because he had cursed her in his verses, but afterwards, repenting\nand writing what are called \u003ci\u003epalinodes\u003c/i\u003e, in which he sang her\npraise, he was restored to sight.

For this purpose, then, he had come that he might\nwin her first, and free her from slavery, while he conferred salvation\nupon men, by making himself known to them. For since the angels ruled the\nworld ill because each one of them coveted the principal power for\nhimself, he had come to amend matters, and had descended, transfigured\nand assimilated to powers and principalities and angels, so that he might\nappear among men to be a man, while yet he was not a man; and that thus\nhe was thought to have suffered in Judæa, when he had not suffered.\nMoreover, the prophets uttered their predictions under the inspiration of\nthose angels who formed the world; for which reason those who place their\ntrust in him and Helena no longer regarded them, but, as being free, live\nas they please; for men are saved through his grace, and not on account\nof their own righteous actions. For such deeds are not righteous in the\nnature of things, but by mere accident, just as those angels who made the\nworld, have thought fit to constitute them, seeking, by means of such\nprecepts, to bring men into bondage. On this account, he pledged himself\nthat the world should be dissolved, and that those who are his should be\nfreed from the rule of them who made the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxiv-p9\"\u003e4.

They also have an image of Simon\nfashioned after the likeness of Jupiter, and another of Helena in the\nshape of Minerva; and these they worship. In fine, they have a name\nderived from Simon, the author of these most impious doctrines, being\ncalled Simonians; and from them “knowledge, falsely so\ncalled,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2939\"\u003e2939\u003c/sup\u003e received its beginning,\nas one may learn even from their own assertions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxiv-p11\"\u003e5.

He affirms that the primary Power\ncontinues unknown to all, but that he himself is the person who has been\nsent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a saviour, for\nthe deliverance of men. The world was made by angels, whom, like Simon,\nhe maintains to have been produced by Ennœa.

This heretic was the first to affirm that two kinds of\nmen were formed by the angels,—the one wicked, and the other\ngood. And since the demons assist the most wicked, the Saviour came for\nthe destruction of evil men and of the demons, but for the salvation of\nthe good.

Basilides again, that he may appear to have\ndiscovered something more sublime and plausible, gives an immense\ndevelopment to his doctrines. He sets forth that Nous was first born of\nthe unborn father, that from him, again, was born Logos, from Logos\nPhronesis, from Phronesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from Dynamis and Sophia\nthe powers, and principalities, and angels, whom he also calls the\n\u003ci\u003efirst\u003c/i\u003e; and that by them the first heaven was made. Then other\npowers, being formed by emanation from these, created another heaven\nsimilar to the first; and in like manner, when others, again, had been\nformed by emanation from them, corresponding exactly to those above them,\nthese, too, framed another third heaven; and then from this third, in\ndownward order, there was a fourth succession of descendants; and so on,\nafter the same fashion, they declare that more and more principalities\nand angels were formed, and three hundred and sixty-five heavens.; and that by them the first heaven was made.

Those angels who occupy the lowest heaven, that,\nnamely, which is visible to us, formed all the things which are in the\nworld, and made allotments among themselves of the earth and of those\nnations which are upon it. The chief of them is he who is thought to be\nthe God of the Jews; and inasmuch as he desired to render the other\nnations subject to his own people, that is, the Jews, all the other\nprinces resisted and opposed him. Wherefore all other nations were at\nenmity with his nation. But the father without birth and without name,\nperceiving that they would be destroyed, sent his own first-begotten Nous\n(he it is who is called Christ) to bestow deliverance on them that\nbelieve in him, from the power of those who made the world. He appeared,\nthen, on earth as a man, to the nations of these powers, and wrought\nmiracles. Wherefore he did not\nhimself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being\ncompelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being\ntransfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified,\nthrough ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of\nSimon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal\npower, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself\nas he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them,\ninasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all.\nThose, then, who know these things have been freed from the\nprincipalities who formed the world; so that it is not incumbent on us to\nconfess him who was crucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and\nwas thought to be crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the\nfather, that by this dispensation he might destroy the works of the\nmakers of the world. If any one, therefore, he declares, confesses the\ncrucified, that man is still a slave, and under the power of those who\nformed our bodies; but he who denies him has been freed from these\nbeings, and is acquainted with the dispensation of the unborn father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxv-p8\"\u003e\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_350.html\" id=\"ix.ii.xxv-Page_350\" n=\"350\" /\u003e\n\n5.

Carpocrates, again, and his followers\nmaintain that the world and the things which are therein were created by\nangels greatly inferior to the unbegotten Father. They also hold that\nJesus was the son of Joseph, and was just like other men, with the\nexception that he differed from them in this respect, that inasmuch as\nhis soul was stedfast and pure, he perfectly remembered those things\nwhich he had witnessed\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2945\"\u003e2945\u003c/sup\u003e within the\nsphere of the unbegotten God. On this account, a power descended upon him\nfrom the Father, that by means of it he might escape from the creators of\nthe world; and they say that it, after passing through them all, and\nremaining in all points free, ascended again to him, and to the\npowers,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2946\"\u003e2946\u003c/sup\u003e which in the same way embraced like things to itself.

The soul, therefore, which is like that of Christ\ncan despise those rulers who were the creators of the world, and, in like\nmanner, receives power for accomplishing the same results. This idea has\nraised them to such a pitch of pride, that some of them declare\nthemselves similar to Jesus; while others, still more mighty, maintain\nthat they are superior to his disciples, such as Peter and Paul, and the\nrest of the apostles, whom they consider to be in no respect inferior to\nJesus. For their souls, descending from the same sphere as his, and\ntherefore despising in like manner the creators of the world, are deemed\nworthy of the same power, and again depart to the same place.

They affirm that for this reason\nJesus spoke the following parable:—“Whilst thou art with\nthine adversary in the way, give all diligence, that thou mayest be\ndelivered from him, lest he give thee up to the judge, and the judge\nsurrender thee to the officer, and he cast thee into prison. Verily, I\nsay unto thee, thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last\nfarthing.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2952\"\u003e2952\u003c/sup\u003e They also declare the\n“adversary” is one of those angels who are in the world, whom\nthey call the Devil, maintaining that he was formed for this purpose,\nthat he might lead those souls which have perished from the world to the\nSupreme Ruler. They describe him also as being chief among the makers of\nthe world, and maintain that he delivers such souls [as have been\nmentioned] to another angel, who ministers to him, that he may shut them\nup in other bodies; for they declare that the body is “the\nprison.” Again, they interpret these expressions, “Thou shalt\nnot go out thence until thou pay the very last farthing,” as\nmeaning that no one can escape from the power of those angels who made\nthe world, but that he must pass from body to body, until he has\nexperience of every kind of action which can be practised in this world,\nand when nothing is longer wanting to him, then his liberated soul should\nsoar upwards to that God who is above the angels, the makers of the\nworld. In this way also all souls are saved, whether their own which,\nguarding against all delay, participate in all sorts of actions during\none incarnation, or those, again, who, by passing from body to body, are\nset free, on fulfilling and accomplishing what is requisite in every form\nof life into which they are sent, so that at length they shall no longer\nbe [shut up] in the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxvi-p13\"\u003e5.

Besides this, he mutilates the Gospel which is\naccording to Luke, removing all that is written respecting the generation\nof the Lord, and setting aside a great deal of the teaching of the Lord,\nin which the Lord is recorded as most dearly confessing that the Maker of\nthis universe is His Father. He likewise persuaded his disciples that he\nhimself was more worthy of credit than are those apostles who have handed\ndown the Gospel to us, furnishing them not with the Gospel, but merely a\nfragment of it. In like manner, too, he dismembered the Epistles of Paul,\nremoving all that is said by the apostle respecting that God who made the\nworld, to the effect that He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and\nalso those passages from the prophetical writings which the apostle\nquotes, in order to teach us that they announced beforehand the coming of\nthe Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxviii-p3\"\u003e3.

This arises from the\nfact that numbers of them—indeed, we may say all—desire\nthemselves to be teachers, and to break off from the particular heresy in\nwhich they have been involved. Forming one set of doctrines out of a\ntotally different system of opinions, and then again others from others,\nthey insist upon teaching something new, declaring themselves the\ninventors of any sort of opinion which they may have been able to call\ninto existence. To give an example:\nSpringing from Saturninus and Marcion, those who are called Encratites\n(self-controlled) preached against marriage, thus setting aside the\noriginal creation of God, and indirectly blaming Him who made the male\nand female for the propagation of the human race. Some of those reckoned\namong them have also introduced abstinence from animal food, thus proving\nthemselves ungrateful to God, who formed all things. They deny, too, the\nsalvation of him who was first created. It is but lately, however, that\nthis opinion has been invented among them. A certain man named Tatian first introduced\nthe blasphemy. He was a hearer of Justin’s, and as long as he\ncontinued with him he expressed no such views; but after his martyrdom he\nseparated from the Church, and, excited and puffed up by the thought of\nbeing a teacher, as if he were superior to others, he composed his own\npeculiar type of doctrine. He invented a system of certain invisible\nÆons, like the followers of Valentinus; while, like Marcion and\nSaturninus, he declared that marriage was nothing else than corruption\nand fornication.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2962\"\u003e2962\u003c/sup\u003e But\nhis denial of Adam’s salvation was an opinion due entirely to\nhimself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxix-p3\"\u003e2. Others, again, following upon Basilides and\nCarpocrates, have introduced promiscuous intercourse and a plurality of\nwives, and are indifferent about eating meats sacrificed to idols,\nmaintaining that God does not greatly regard such matters. But why\ncontinue? For it is an impracticable attempt to mention all those who, in\none way or another, have fallen away from the truth.\u003c/p\u003e",

Unless it had possessed that, it would\nperhaps have been totally absorbed in, and overwhelmed by, material\nsubstance. Being therefore bound down by a body which was composed of\nmatter, and greatly burdened by it, this power regretted the course it\nhad followed, and made an attempt to escape from the waters and ascend to\nits mother: it could not effect this, however, on account of the weight\nof the body lying over and around it. But feeling very ill at ease, it\nendeavoured at least to conceal that light which came from above, fearing\nlest it too might be injured by the inferior elements, as had happened to\nitself. And when it had received power from that besprinkling of light\nwhich it possessed, it sprang back again, and was borne aloft; and being\non high, it extended itself, covered [a portion of space], and formed\nthis visible heaven out of its body; yet remained under the heaven which\nit made, as still possessing the form of a watery body. But when it had\nconceived a desire for the light above, and had received power by all\nthings, it laid down this body, and was freed from it. This body which\nthey speak of that power as having thrown off, they call a female from a\nfemale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-p5\"\u003e4. They declare, moreover, that her son had also\nhimself a certain breath of incorruption left him by his mother, and that\nthrough means of it he works; and becoming powerful, he himself, as they\naffirm, also sent forth from the waters a son without a mother; for they\ndo not allow him either to have known a mother. His son, again, after the\nexample of his father, sent forth another son. This third one, too,\ngenerated a fourth; the fourth also generated a son: they maintain that\nagain a son was generated by the fifth; and the sixth, too, generated a\nseventh. Thus was the Hebdomad, according to them, completed, the mother\npossessing the eighth place; and as in the case of their generations, so\nalso in regard to dignities and powers, they precede each other in\nturn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-p6\"\u003e5.

Moreover, they\nrepresent these heavens, potentates, powers, angels, and creators, as\nsitting in their proper order in heaven, according to their generation,\nand as invisibly ruling over things celestial and terrestrial. The first\nof them, namely Ialdabaoth, holds his mother in contempt, inasmuch as he\nproduced sons and grandsons without the permission of any one, yea, even\nangels, archangels, powers, potentates, and dominions. After these things\nhad been done, his sons turned to strive and quarrel with him about the\nsupreme power,—conduct which deeply grieved Ialdabaoth, and drove\nhim to despair. In these circumstances, he cast his eyes upon the\nsubjacent dregs of matter, and fixed his desire upon it, to which they\ndeclare his son owes his origin. This son is Nous himself, twisted into the\nform of a serpent;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2970\"\u003e2970\u003c/sup\u003e and hence were derived the spirit, the soul, and\nall mundane things: from this too were generated all oblivion,\nwickedness, emulation, envy, and death.

On this account, Ialdabaoth, becoming uplifted in\nspirit, boasted himself over all those things that were below him, and\nexclaimed, “I am father, and God, and above me there is no\none.” But his mother,\nhearing him speak thus, cried out against him, “Do not lie,\nIaldabaoth: for the father of all, the first Anthropos (man), is above\nthee; and so is Anthropos the son of Anthropos.” Then, as all were\ndisturbed by this new voice, and by the unexpected proclamation, and as\nthey were inquiring whence the noise proceeded, in order to lead them\naway and attract them to himself, they affirm that Ialdabaoth exclaimed,\n“Come, let us make man after our image.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2972\"\u003e2972\u003c/sup\u003e The six powers, on hearing this, and their mother furnishing them\nwith the idea of a man (in order that by means of him she might empty\nthem of their original power), jointly formed a man of immense size, both\nin regard to breadth and length. But as he could merely writhe along the\nground, they carried him to their father; Sophia so labouring in this\nmatter, that she might empty him (Ialdabaoth) of the light with which he\nhad been sprinkled, so that he might no longer, though still powerful, be\nable to lift up himself against the powers above. They declare, then,\nthat by breathing\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_356.html\" id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-Page_356\" n=\"356\" /\u003e\n\ninto man the spirit of life, he was\nsecretly emptied of his power; that hence man became a possessor of nous\n(intelligence) and enthymesis (thought); and they affirm that these are\nthe faculties which partake in salvation.

But Ialdabaoth,\nfeeling envious at this, was pleased to form the design of again emptying\nman by means of woman, and produced a woman from his own enthymesis, whom\nthat Prunicus [above mentioned] laying hold\nof, imperceptibly emptied her of power. But the others coming and\nadmiring her beauty, named her Eve, and falling in love with her, begat\nsons by her, whom they also declare to be the angels. But their mother\n(Sophia) cunningly devised a scheme to seduce Eve and Adam, by means of\nthe serpent, to transgress the command of Ialdabaoth. Eve listened to\nthis as if it had proceeded from a son of God, and yielded an easy\nbelief. She also persuaded Adam to eat of the tree regarding which God\nhad said that they should not eat of it. They then declare that, on their\nthus eating, they attained to the knowledge of that power which is above\nall, and departed from those who had created them.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2973\"\u003e2973\u003c/sup\u003e When\nPrunicus perceived that the powers were thus baffled by their own\ncreature, she greatly rejoiced, and again cried out, that since the\nfather was incorruptible, he (Ialdabaoth) who formerly called himself the\nfather was a liar; and that, while Anthropos and the first woman (the\nSpirit) existed previously, this one (Eve) sinned by committing\nadultery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-p14\"\u003e8. Ialdabaoth, however, through that oblivion in which\nhe was involved, and not paying any regard to these things, cast Adam and\nEve out of Paradise, because they had transgressed his commandment. For\nhe had a desire to beget sons by Eve, but did not accomplish his wish,\nbecause his mother opposed him in every point, and secretly emptied Adam\nand Eve of the light with which they had been sprinkled, in order that\nthat spirit which proceeded from the supreme power might participate\nneither in the curse nor opprobrium [caused by transgression]. They also\nteach that, thus being emptied of the divine substance, they were cursed\nby him, and cast down from heaven to this world.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2974\"\u003e2974\u003c/sup\u003e But the serpent\nalso, who was acting against the father, was cast down by him into this\nlower world; he reduced, however, under his power the angels here, and\nbegat six sons, he himself forming the seventh person, after the example\nof that Hebdomad which surrounds the father. They further declare that\nthese are the seven mundane demons, who always oppose and resist the\nhuman race, because it was on their account that their father was cast\ndown to this lower world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-p16\"\u003e9. Adam and Eve previously had light, and clear, and as\nit were spiritual bodies, such as they were at their creation; but when\nthey came to this world, these changed into bodies more opaque, and\ngross, and sluggish. Their soul also was feeble and languid, inasmuch as\nthey had received from their creator a merely mundane inspiration. This\ncontinued until Prunicus, moved with compassion towards them, restored to\nthem the sweet savour of the besprinkling of light, by means of which\nthey came to a remembrance of themselves, and knew that they were naked,\nas well as that the body was a material substance, and thus recognised\nthat they bore death about with them. They thereupon became patient,\nknowing that only for a time they would be enveloped in the body. They\nalso found out food, through the guidance of Sophia; and when they were\nsatisfied, they had carnal knowledge of each other, and begat Cain, whom\nthe serpent, that had been cast down along with his sons, immediately\nlaid hold of and destroyed by filling him with mundane oblivion, and\nurging into folly and audacity, so that, by slaying his brother Abel, he\nwas the first to bring to light envy and death. After these, they affirm\nthat, by the forethought of Prunicus, Seth was begotten, and then\nNorea,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2975\"\u003e2975\u003c/sup\u003e from whom they\nrepresent all the rest of mankind as being descended.

Ialdabaoth, again, being incensed with men, because\nthey did not worship or honour him as father and God, sent forth a deluge\nupon them, that he might at once destroy them all. But Sophia opposed him\nin this point also, and Noah and his family were saved in the ark by\nmeans of the besprinkling of that light which proceeded from her, and\nthrough it the world was again filled with mankind. Ialdabaoth himself\nchose a certain man named Abraham from among these, and made a covenant\nwith him, to the effect that, if his seed continued to serve him, he\nwould give to them the earth for an inheritance. Afterwards, by means of\nMoses, he\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_357.html\" id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-Page_357\" n=\"357\" /\u003e\n\nbrought forth Abraham’s descendants from\nEgypt, and gave them the law, and made them the Jews.

Moreover, they distribute the prophets in the\nfollowing manner: Moses, and Joshua the son of Nun, and Amos, and\nHabakkuk, belonged to Ialdabaoth; Samuel, and Nathan, and Jonah, and\nMicah, to Iao; Elijah, Joel, and Zechariah to Sabaoth; Isaiah, Ezekiel,\nJeremiah, and Daniel, to Adonai; Tobias and Haggai to Eloi; Michaiah and\nNahum to Oreus; Esdras and Zephaniah to Astanphæus. Each one of these,\nthen, glorifies his own father and God, and they maintain that Sophia,\nherself has also spoken many things through them regarding the first\nAnthropos (man),\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2978\"\u003e2978\u003c/sup\u003e and concerning\nthat Christ who is above, thus admonishing and reminding men of the\nincorruptible light, the first Anthropos, and of the descent of Christ.\nThe [other] powers being terrified by these things, and marvelling at the\nnovelty of those things which were announced by the prophets, Prunicus\nbrought it about by means of Ialdabaoth (who knew not what he did), that\nemissions of two men took place, the one from the barren Elizabeth, and\nthe other from the Virgin Mary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-p23\"\u003e12. And\nsince she herself had no rest either in heaven or on earth, she invoked\nher mother to assist her in her distress. Upon this, her mother, the\nfirst woman, was moved with compassion towards her daughter, on her\nrepentance, and begged from the first man that Christ should be sent to\nher assistance, who, being sent forth, descended to his sister, and to\nthe besprinkling of light. When he recognised her (that is, the Sophia\nbelow), her brother descended to her, and announced his advent through\nmeans of John, and prepared the baptism of repentance, and adopted Jesus\nbeforehand, in order that on Christ descending he might find a pure\nvessel, and that by the son of that Ialdabaoth the woman might be\nannounced by Christ. They further declare that he descended through the\nseven heavens, having assumed the likeness of their sons, and gradually\nemptied them of their power. For they maintain that the whole\nbesprinkling of light rushed to him, and that Christ, descending to this\nworld, first clothed his sister Sophia [with it], and that then both\nexulted in the mutual refreshment they felt in each other’s\nsociety: this scene they describe as relating to bridegroom and bride.\nBut Jesus, inasmuch as he was begotten of the Virgin through the agency\nof God, was wiser, purer, and more righteous than all other men: Christ\nunited to Sophia descended into him, and thus Jesus Christ was\nproduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-p24\"\u003e13. They affirm that many of his disciples were not\naware of the descent of Christ into him; but that, when Christ did\ndescend on Jesus, he then began to work miracles, and heal, and announce\nthe unknown Father, and openly to confess himself the son of the first\nman. The powers and the father of Jesus were angry at these proceedings,\nand laboured to destroy him; and when he was being led away for this\npurpose, they say that Christ himself, along with Sophia, departed from\nhim into the state of an incorruptible Æon, while Jesus was crucified.\nChrist, however, was not forgetful of his Jesus, but sent down a certain\nenergy into him from above, which raised him up again in the body, which\nthey call both animal and spiritual; for he sent the mundane parts back\nagain into the world. When his disciples saw that he had risen, they did\nnot recognise him—no, not even Jesus himself, by whom he rose\nagain from the dead. And they assert that this very great error prevailed\namong his disciples, that they imagined he had risen in a mundane body,\nnot knowing that “flesh\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2979\"\u003e2979\u003c/sup\u003e and blood do not attain to\nthe kingdom of God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.ii.xxxi-p26\"\u003e14.

But after his resurrection he\ntarried [on earth] eighteen months; and knowledge descending into him\nfrom above, he taught what was clear. He instructed a few of his\ndisciples, whom he knew to be capable of understanding so great\nmysteries, in these things, and was then received up into heaven, Christ\nsitting down at the right hand of his father Ialdabaoth, that he may\nreceive to himself the souls of those who have known them,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2980\"\u003e2980\u003c/sup\u003e after they have laid aside their mundane flesh, thus\nenriching himself without the knowledge or perception of his father; so\nthat, in proportion as Jesus enriches himself with holy souls, to such an\nextent does his father suffer loss and is diminished, being emptied of\nhis own power by these souls.

But let them\nrather, learning to good effect from us the wicked tenets of these men,\nlook with contempt upon their doctrines, while at the same time they pity\nthose who, still cleaving to these miserable and baseless fables, have\nreached such a pitch of arrogance as to reckon themselves superior to all\nothers on account of such knowledge, or, as it should rather be called,\nignorance.

So, in our case, since we have brought their\nhidden mysteries, which they keep in silence among themselves, to the\nlight, it will not now be necessary to use many words in destroying their\nsystem of opinions. For it is now in thy power, and in the power of all\nthy associates, to familiarize yourselves with what has been said, to\noverthrow their wicked and undigested doctrines, and to set forth\ndoctrines agreeable to the truth.

Now, since there exists, according to them, also\nsomething else which they declare to be outside of the Pleroma, into\nwhich they further hold there descended that higher power who went\nastray, it is in every way necessary that the Pleroma either contains\nthat which is beyond, yet is contained (for otherwise, it will not be\nbeyond the Pleroma; for if there is anything beyond the Pleroma, there\nwill be a Pleroma within this very Pleroma which they declare to be\noutside of the Pleroma, and the Pleroma will be contained by that which\nis beyond: and with the Pleroma is understood also the first God); or,\nagain, they must be an infinite distance separated from each other\n—the Pleroma [I mean], and that which is beyond it. But if they\nmaintain this, there will then be a third kind of existence, which\nseparates by immensity the Pleroma and that which is beyond it. This\nthird kind of existence will therefore bound and contain both the others,\nand will be greater both than the Pleroma, and than that which is beyond\nit, inasmuch as it contains both in its bosom. In this way, talk might go\non for ever concerning those things which are contained, and those which\ncontain. For if this third existence has its beginning above, and its end\nbeneath, there is an absolute necessity that it be also bounded on the\nsides, either beginning or ceasing at certain other points, [where new\nexistences begin.] These, again, and others which are above and below,\nwill have their beginnings at certain other points, and so on ad\n\u003ci\u003einfinitum\u003c/i\u003e; so that their thoughts would never rest in one God,\nbut, in consequence of seeking after more than exists, would wander away\nto that which has no existence, and depart from the true God.; so that their thoughts would never rest in one God,\nbut, in consequence of seeking after more than exists, would wander away\nto that which has no existence, and depart from the true God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.ii-p4\"\u003e4. These remarks are, in like manner, applicable\nagainst the followers of Marcion. For his two gods will also be contained\nand circumscribed by an immense interval which separates them from one\nanother. But then there is a necessity to suppose a multitude of gods\nseparated by an immense distance from each other on every side, beginning\nwith one another, and ending in one another. Thus, by that very process\nof reasoning on which they depend for teaching that there is a certain\nPleroma or God above the Creator of heaven and earth, any one who chooses\nto employ it may maintain that there is another Pleroma above the\nPleroma, above that again another, and above Bythus another ocean of\nDeity, while in like manner the same successions hold with respect to the\nsides; and thus, their doctrine flowing out into immensity, there will\nalways be a necessity to conceive of other Pleroma, and other Bythi, so\nas never at any time to stop, but always to continue seeking for others\nbesides those already mentioned. Moreover, it will be uncertain whether\nthese which we conceive of are below, or are, in fact, themselves the\nthings which are above; and, in like manner, [it will be doubtful]\nrespecting those things which are said by them to be above, whether they\nare really above or below; and thus our opinions will have no fixed\nconclusion or certainty, but will of necessity wander forth after worlds\nwithout limits, and gods that cannot be numbered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.ii-p5\"\u003e5. These things, then, being so, each deity will be\ncontented with his own possessions, and will not be moved with any\ncuriosity respecting the affairs of others; otherwise he would be unjust,\nand rapacious, and would cease to be what God is. Each creation, too,\nwill glorify its own maker, and will be contented with him, not knowing\nany other; otherwise it would most justly be deemed an apostate by all\nthe others, and would receive a richly-deserved punishment. For it must\nbe either that there is one Being who contains all things, and formed in\nHis own territory all those things which have been created, according to\nHis own will; or, again, that there are numerous unlimited creators and\ngods, who begin from each other, and end in each other on every side; and\nit will then be necessary to allow that all the rest are contained from\nwithout by some one who is greater, and that they are each of them shut\nup within their own territory, and remain in it. No one of them all,\ntherefore, is God. For there will be [much] wanting to every one of them,\npossessing [as he will do] only a very small part when compared with all\nthe rest. The name of the Omnipotent will thus be brought to an end, and\nsuch an opinion will of necessity fall to impiety.\u003c/p\u003e",

Next let them tell us whether these things have been\nformed within the limits which are contained by Him, and in His proper\nterritory, or in regions belonging to others, and lying beyond Him? But\nif they say [that these things were done] beyond Him, then all the\nabsurdities already mentioned will face them, and the Supreme God will be\nenclosed by that which is beyond Him, in which also it will be necessary\nthat He should find His end. If, on the other hand, [these things were\ndone] within His own proper territory, it will be very idle to say that\nthe world was thus formed within His proper territory against His will by\nangels who are themselves under His power, or by any other being, as if\neither He Himself did not behold all things which take place among His\nown possessions, or\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"2991\"\u003e2991\u003c/sup\u003e was not aware of the things to be\ndone by angels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.iii-p5\"\u003e3. If, however, [the things referred to were done] not\nagainst His will, but with His concurrence and knowledge, as some [of\nthese men] think, the angels, or the Former of the world [whoever that\nmay have been], will no longer be the causes of that formation, but the\nwill of God. For if He is the Former of the world, \u003ci\u003eHe\u003c/i\u003e too made the\nangels, or at least was the cause of their creation; and He will be\nregarded as having made the world who prepared the causes of its\nformation. Although they maintain that the angels were made by a long\nsuccession downwards, or that the Former of the world [sprang] from the\nSupreme Father, as Basilides asserts; nevertheless that which is the\ncause of those things which have been made will still be traced to Him\nwho was the Author of such a succession. [The case stands] just as\nregards success in war, which is ascribed to the king who prepared those\nthings which are the cause of victory; and, in like manner, the creation\nof any state, or of any work, is referred to him who prepared materials\nfor the accomplishment of those results which were afterwards brought\nabout. Wherefore, we do not say that it was the axe which cut the wood,\nor the saw which divided it; but one would very properly say that the\n too made the\nangels, or at least was the cause of their creation; and He will be\nregarded as having made the world who prepared the causes of its\nformation.

Moreover, if it\nproceeded from the same source [as they did], it must be similar in\nnature to Him who produced it, as well as to those along with whom it was\nproduced. There will\ntherefore be an absolute necessity, both that the Bythus of whom they\nspeak, along with Sige, be similar in nature to a vacuum, that is, that\nHe really is a vacuum; and that the rest of the Æons, since they are the\nbrothers of vacuity, should also be devoid\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3001\"\u003e3001\u003c/sup\u003e of substance. If, on the other hand, it has\nnot been thus produced, it must have sprang from and been generated by\nitself, and in that case it will be equal in point of age to that Bythus\nwho is, according to them, the Father of all; and thus vacuity will be of\nthe same nature and of the same honour with Him who is, according to\nthem, the universal Father. For it must of necessity have been either\nproduced by some one, or generated by itself, and sprung from itself. But\nif, in truth, vacuity was produced, then its producer Valentinus is also\na vacuum, as are likewise his followers. If, again, it was not produced,\nbut was generated by itself, then that which is really a vacuum is\nsimilar to, and the brother of, and of the same honour with, that Father\nwho has been proclaimed by Valentinus; while it is more ancient, and\ndating its existence from a period greatly anterior, and more exalted in\nhonour than the remaining Æons of Ptolemy himself, and Heracleon, and\nall the rest\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3002\"\u003e3002\u003c/sup\u003e who hold the same opinions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.v-p4\"\u003e2.

Such a mode of acting would truly entail [the charge of]\ndegeneracy upon the entire Pleroma, since it might from the first have\ncut off that defect, and those emanations which derived their origin from\nit, in reference\nto knowledge and ignorance, and not with respect to local distance; but\nthat, in the Pleroma, or in those things which are contained by the\nFather, the whole creation which we know to have been formed, having been\nmade by the Demiurge, or by the angels, is contained by the unspeakable\ngreatness, as the centre is in a circle, or as a spot is in a garment,\n—then, in the first place, what sort of a being must that Bythus\nbe, who allows a stain to have place in His own bosom, and permits\nanother one to create or produce within His territory, contrary to His\nown will?

Or if\nat the first he allowed that the things which were made [should be as\nthey are], since they could not, in fact, be formed otherwise, then it\nfollows that they must always continue in the same condition. For how is\nit possible, that those things which cannot at the first obtain\nrectification, should subsequently receive it? Or how can men say that\nthey are called to perfection, when those very beings who are the causes\nfrom which men derive their origin—either the Demiurge himself,\nor the angels—are declared to exist in defect? And if, as is\nmaintained, [the Supreme Being,] inasmuch as He is benignant, did at last\ntake pity upon men, and bestow on them perfection, He ought at first to\nhave pitied those who were the creators of man, and to have conferred on\nthem perfection. In this way, men too would verily have shared in His\ncompassion, being formed perfect by those that were perfect. For if He\npitied the \u003ci\u003ework\u003c/i\u003e of these beings, He ought long before to have\npitied  of these beings, He ought long before to have\npitied \u003ci\u003ethemselves\u003c/i\u003e, and not to have allowed them to fall into such\nawful blindness., and not to have allowed them to fall into such\nawful blindness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.v-p7\"\u003e3. Their talk also about shadow and vacuity, in which\nthey maintain that the creation with which we are concerned was formed,\nwill be brought to nothing, if the things referred to were created within\nthe territory which is contained by the Father. For if they hold that the\nlight of their Father is such that it fills all things which are inside\nof Him, and illuminates them all, how can any vacuum or shadow possibly\nexist within that territory which is contained by the Pleroma, and by the\nlight of the Father? For, in that case, it behoves them to point out some\nplace within the Propator, or within the Pleroma, which is not\nilluminated, nor kept possession of by any one, and in which either the\nangels or the Demiurge formed whatever they pleased. Nor will it be a\nsmall amount of space in which such and so great a creation can be\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_364.html\" id=\"ix.iii.v-Page_364\" n=\"364\" /\u003e\n\nconceived of as having been formed.

And if the\nFather of all be a slave to necessity, and must yield to fate, while He\nunwillingly tolerates the things which are done, but is at the same time\npowerless to do anything in opposition to necessity and fate (like the\nHomeric Jupiter, who says of necessity, “I have willingly given\nthee, yet with unwilling mind”), then, according to this reasoning,\nthe Bythus of whom they speak will be found to be the slave of necessity\nand fate.\u003c/p\u003e",

By way of parallel,\nshall not those who live under the empire of the Romans, although they\nhave never seen the emperor, but are far separated from him both by land\nand sea, know very well, as they experience his rule, who it is that\npossesses the principal power in the state?

But those things which, as soon as they are made, come to\nan end, may justly be said rather to have been formed for the contempt of\nsuch as are thought to be honoured by them; and that that which is\neternal is contumeliously treated when its image is corrupted and\ndissolved.

Apart from this, however, how can those things which\nbelong to creation, various, manifold, and innumerable as they are, be\nthe images of those thirty Æons which are within the Pleroma, whose\nnames, as these men fix them, I have set forth in the book which precedes\nthis? And not only will they be unable to adapt the [vast] variety of\ncreation at large to the [comparative] smallness of their Pleroma, but\nthey cannot do this even with respect to any one part of it, whether\n[that possessed by] celestial or terrestrial beings, or those that live\nin the waters. For they themselves testify that their Pleroma consists of\nthirty Æons; but any one will undertake to show that, in a single\ndepartment of those [created beings] which have been mentioned, they\nreckon that there are not thirty, but many thousands of species. How then\ncan those things, which constitute such a multiform creation, which are\nopposed in nature to each other, and disagree among themselves, and\ndestroy the one the other, be the images and likenesses of the thirty\nÆons of the Pleroma, if indeed, as they declare, these being possessed\nof one nature, are of equal and similar properties, and exhibit no\ndifferences [among themselves]? For it was incumbent, if these things are\nimages of those Æons,—inasmuch as they declare that some men are\nwicked by nature, and some, on the other hand, naturally good,—to\npoint out such differences also among their Æons, and to maintain that\nsome of them were produced naturally good, while some were naturally\nevil, so that the supposition of the likeness of those things might\nharmonize with the Æons. Moreover, since there are in the world some\ncreatures that are gentle, and others that are fierce, some that are\ninnocuous, while others are hurtful and destroy the rest; some have their\nabode on the earth, others in the water, others in the air, and others in\nthe heaven; in like manner, they are bound to show that the Æons possess\nsuch properties, if indeed the one are the images of the others. And\nbesides; “the eternal fire which the Father has prepared for the\ndevil and his angels,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3020\"\u003e3020\u003c/sup\u003e—\nthey ought to show of which of those Æons that are above it is the\nimage; for it, too, is reckoned part of the creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.viii-p10\"\u003e4. If, however, they say that these things are the\nimages of the Enthymesis of that Æon who fell into passion, then, first\nof all, they will act impiously against their Mother, by declaring her to\nbe the first cause of evil and corruptible images. And then, again, how\ncan those things which are manifold, and dissimilar, and contrary in\ntheir nature, be the images of one and the same Being? And if they say\nthat the angels of the Pleroma are numerous, and that those things which\nare many are the images of these—not in this way either will the\naccount they give be satisfactory. For, in the first place, they are then\nbound to point out differences among the angels of the Pleroma, which are\nmutually opposed to each other, even as the images existing below are of\na contrary nature among themselves. And then, again, since there are\nmany, yea, innumerable angels who surround the Creator, as all the\nprophets acknowledge,—[saying, for instance,] “Ten thousand\ntimes ten thousand stood beside Him, and many thousands of thousands\nministered unto Him,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3021\"\u003e3021\u003c/sup\u003e—then, according\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3022\"\u003e3022\u003c/sup\u003e to\nthem, the angels of the Pleroma will have as images the angels of the\nCreator, and the entire creation remains in the image of the Pleroma, but\nso that the thirty Æons no longer correspond to the manifold variety of\nthe creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.viii-p13\"\u003e5. Still further, if these things [below] were made\nafter the similitude of those [above], after the likeness of which again\nwill those then be made? For if the Creator of the world did not form\nthese things directly from His own\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3023\"\u003e3023\u003c/sup\u003e\nconception, but, like an architect of no ability, or a boy receiving his\nfirst lesson, copied them from archetypes furnished by others, then\nwhence did their Bythus obtain the forms of that creation which He at\nfirst produced?

But, again, how can these things [below] be images\nof those [above], since they are really contrary to them, and can in no\nrespect have sympathy with them? For those things which are contrary to\neach other may indeed be destructive of those to which they are contrary,\nbut can by no means be their images—as, for instance, water and\nfire; or, again, light and darkness, and other such things, can never be\nthe images of one another. In like manner, neither can those things which\nare corruptible and earthly, and of a compound nature, and transitory, be\nthe images of those which, according to these men, are spiritual; unless\nthese very things themselves be allowed to be compound, limited in space,\nand of a definite shape, and thus no longer spiritual, and diffused, and\nspreading into vast extent, and incomprehensible. For they must of\nnecessity be possessed of a definite figure, and confined within certain\nlimits, that they may be true images; and then it is decided that they\nare not spiritual. If, however, these men maintain that they are\nspiritual, and diffused, and incomprehensible, how can those things which\nare possessed of figure, and confined within certain limits, be the\nimages of such as are destitute of figure and incomprehensible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.viii-p16\"\u003e7. If, again, they affirm that neither according to\nconfiguration nor formation, but according to number and the order of\nproduction, those things [above] are the images [of these below], then,\nin the first place, these things [below] ought not to be spoken of as\nimages and likenesses of those Æons that are above. For how can the\nthings which have neither the fashion nor shape of those [above] be their\nimages? And, in the next place, they would adapt both the numbers and\nproductions of the Æons above, so as to render them identical with and\nsimilar to those that belong to the creation [below]. But now, since they\nrefer to only thirty Æons, and declare that the vast multitude of things\nwhich are embraced within the creation [below] are images of those that\nare but thirty, we may justly condemn them as utterly destitute of\nsense.\u003c/p\u003e",

We may\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3036\"\u003e3036\u003c/sup\u003e remark, in\nthe first place, regarding their Triacontad, that the whole of it\nmarvellously falls to ruin on both sides, that is, both as respects\ndefect and excess. They say that to indicate it the Lord came to be\nbaptized at the age of thirty years. But this assertion really amounts to\na manifest subversion of their entire argument. As to defect, this\nhappens as follows: first of all, because they reckon the Propator among\nthe other Æons. For the Father of all ought not to be counted with other\nproductions; He who was not produced with that which was produced; He who\nwas unbegotten with that which was born; He whom no one comprehends with\nthat which is comprehended by Him, and who is on this account [Himself]\nincomprehensible; and He who is without figure with that which has a\ndefinite shape. For inasmuch as He is superior to the rest, He ought not\nto be numbered with them, and that so that He who is impassible and not\nin error should be reckoned with an Æon subject to passion, and actually\nin error. For I have shown in the book which immediately precedes this,\nthat, beginning with Bythus, they reckon up the Triacontad to Sophia,\nwhom they describe as the erring Æon; and I have also there set forth\nthe names of their [Æons]; but if He be not reckoned, there are no\nlonger, on their own showing, thirty productions of Æons, but these then\nbecome only twenty-nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiii-p3\"\u003e2. Next, with respect to the first production Ennœa,\nwhom they also term Sige, from whom again they describe Nous and Aletheia\nas having been sent forth, they err in both particulars. For it is\nimpossible that the thought (Ennœa) of any one, or his silence (Sige),\nshould be understood apart from himself; and that, being sent forth\nbeyond him, it should possess a special figure of its own. But if they\nassert that the (Ennœa) was not sent forth beyond Him, but continued one\nwith the Propator, why then do they reckon her with the other Æons\n—with those who were not one [with the Father], and are on this\naccount ignorant of His greatness? If, however, she was so united (let us\ntake this also into consideration), there is then an absolute necessity,\nthat from this united and inseparable conjunction, which constitutes but\none being, there\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3037\"\u003e3037\u003c/sup\u003e should proceed an unseparated and united\nproduction, so that it should not be dissimilar to Him who sent it forth.\nBut if this be so, then just as Bythus and Sige, so also Nous and\nAletheia will form one and the same being, ever cleaving mutually\ntogether. And inasmuch as the one cannot be conceived of without the\nother, just as water cannot [be conceived of] without [the thought of]\nmoisture, or fire without [the thought of] heat, or a stone without [the\nthought] of hardness (for these things are mutually bound together, and\nthe one cannot be separated from the other, but always co-exists with\nit), so it behoves Bythus to be united in the same way with Ennœa, and\nNous with Aletheia. Logos and Zoe again, as being sent forth by those\nthat are thus united, ought themselves to be united, and to constitute\nonly one being. But, according to such a process of reasoning, Homo and\nEcclesia too, and indeed all the remaining conjunctions of the Æons\nproduced, ought to be united, and always to co-exist, the one with the\nother. For there is a necessity in their opinion, that a female Æon\nshould exist side by side with a male one, inasmuch as she is, so to\nspeak, [the forthputting of] his affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiii-p5\"\u003e3. These\nthings being so, and such opinions being proclaimed by them, they again\nventure, without a blush, to teach that the younger Æon of the Duodecad,\nwhom they also style Sophia, did, apart from union with her consort, whom\nthey call Theletus, endure passion, and separately, without any\nassistance from him, gave birth to a production which they name “a\nfemale from a female.” They thus rush into such utter frenzy, as to\nform two most clearly opposite opinions respecting the same point. For if\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_372.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xiii-Page_372\" n=\"372\" /\u003e\n\nBythus is ever one with Sige, Nous with Aletheia, Logos with\nZoe, and so on, as respects the rest, how could Sophia, without union\nwith her consort, either suffer or generate anything? And if, again, she\ndid really suffer passion apart from him, it necessarily follows that the\nother conjunctions also admit of disjunction and separation among\nthemselves,—a thing which I have already shown to be impossible.\nIt is also impossible, therefore, that Sophia suffered passion apart from\nTheletus; and thus, again, their whole system of argument is overthrown.\nFor they have yet\n\nBythus is ever one with Sige, Nous with Aletheia, Logos with\nZoe, and so on, as respects the rest, how could Sophia, without union\nwith her consort, either suffer or generate anything?

If, however, they impudently maintain, in order to\npreserve from ruin their vain imaginations, that the rest of the\nconjunctions also were disjoined and separated from one another on\naccount of this latest conjunction, then [I reply that], in the first\nplace, they rest upon a thing which is impossible. For how can they\nseparate the Propator from his Ennœa, or Nous from Aletheia, or Logos\nfrom Zoe, and so on with the rest? And how can they themselves maintain\nthat they tend again to unity, and are, in fact, all at one, if indeed\nthese very conjunctions, which are within the Pleroma, do not preserve\nunity, but are separate from one another; and that to such a degree, that\nthey both endure passion and perform the work of generation without union\none with another, just as hens do apart from intercourse with cocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiii-p8\"\u003e5. Then, again, their first and first-begotten Ogdoad\nwill be overthrown as follows: They must admit that Bythus and Sige, Nous\nand Aletheia, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, do individually\ndwell in the same Pleroma. But it is impossible that Sige\n(silence) can exist in the presence of Logos (speech), or again, that\nLogos can manifest himself in the presence of Sige. For these are\nmutually destructive of each other, even as light and darkness can by no\npossibility exist in the same place: for if light prevails, there cannot\nbe darkness; and if darkness, there cannot be light, since, where light\nappears, darkness is put to flight. In like manner, where Sige is, there\ncannot be Logos; and where Logos is, there certainly cannot be Sige. But\nif they say that Logos simply exists within\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3039\"\u003e3039\u003c/sup\u003e (unexpressed), Sige also will exist within,\nand will not the less be destroyed by the Logos within. But that he\nreally is not merely conceived of in the mind, the very order of the\nproduction of their (Æons) shows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiii-p10\"\u003e6. Let them not then declare that the first and\nprincipal Ogdoad consists of Logos and Sige, but let them [as a matter of\nnecessity] exclude either Sige or Logos; and then their first and\nprincipal Ogdoad is at an end. For if they describe the conjunctions [of\nthe Æons] as united, then their whole argument fails to pieces. Since,\nif they were united, how could Sophia have generated a defect without\nunion with her consort? If, on the other hand, they maintain that, as in\nproduction, each of the Æons possesses his own peculiar substance, then\nhow can Sige and Logos manifest themselves in the same place? So far,\nthen, with respect to defect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiii-p11\"\u003e7. But again, their Triacontad is overthrown as to\nexcess by the following considerations. They represent Horos (whom they\ncall by a variety of names which I have mentioned in the preceding book)\nas having been produced by Monogenes just like the other Æons. Some of\nthem maintain that this Horos was produced by Monogenes, while others\naffirm that he was sent forth by the Propator himself in His own image.\nThey affirm further, that a production was formed by Monogenes—\nChrist and the Holy Spirit; and they do not reckon these in the number of\nthe Pleroma, nor the Saviour either, whom they also declare to be\n\u003ci\u003eTotum\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3040\"\u003e3040\u003c/sup\u003e (all things). Now, it is evident even\nto a blind man, that not merely thirty productions, as they maintain,\nwere sent forth, but four more along with these thirty. For they reckon\nthe Propator himself in the Pleroma, and those too, who in succession\nwere produced by one another. Why is it, then, that those [other beings]\nare not reckoned as existing with these in the same Pleroma, since they\nwere produced in the same manner? For what just reason can they assign\nfor not reckoning along with the other Æons, either Christ, whom they\ndescribe as having, according to the Father’s will, been produced\nby Monogenes, or the Holy Spirit, or Horos, whom they also call\nSoter\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3041\"\u003e3041\u003c/sup\u003e\n(Saviour), and not even the Saviour Himself, who came to impart\nassistance and form to their Mother? Whether is this as if these latter\nwere weaker than the former, and therefore unworthy of the name of Æons,\nor of being numbered among them, or as if they were superior and more\nexcellent? But how could they be weaker, since they were produced for the\nestablishment and rectification of the others? And then, again, they\ncannot possibly be superior to the first and principal Tetrad, by which\nthey were also produced; for it, too, is reckoned in the number above\nmentioned.\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_373.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xiii-Page_373\" n=\"373\" /\u003e\n\nThese latter beings, then, ought also to have\nbeen numbered in the Pleroma of the Æons, or that should be deprived of\nthe honour of those Æons which bear this appellation (the Tetrad).\n\nThese latter beings, then, ought also to have\nbeen numbered in the Pleroma of the Æons, or that should be deprived of\nthe honour of those Æons which bear this appellation (the Tetrad).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiii-p14\"\u003e8. Since, therefore, their Triacontad is thus brought\nto nought, as I have shown, both with respect to defect and excess (for\nin dealing with such a number, either excess or defect [to any extent]\nwill render the number untenable, and how much more so great\nvariations?), it follows that what they maintain respecting their Ogdoad\nand Duodecad is a mere fable which cannot stand. Their whole system,\nmoreover, falls to the ground, when their very foundation is destroyed\nand dissolved into Bythus,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3042\"\u003e3042\u003c/sup\u003e that is, into what has\nno existence.

I now proceed to show, as follows,\nthat the first order of production, as conceived of by them, must be\nrejected. For they maintain that Nous and Aletheia were produced from\nBythus and his Ennœa, which is proved to be a contradiction. For Nous is\nthat which is itself chief, and highest, and, as it were, the principle\nand source of all understanding. Ennœa, again, which arises from him, is\nany sort of emotion concerning any subject. It cannot be, therefore, that\nNous was produced by Bythus and Ennœa; it would be more like the truth\nfor them to maintain that Ennœa was produced as the daughter of the\nPropator and this Nous. For Ennœa is not the daughter of Nous, as they\nassert, but Nous becomes the father of Ennœa. For how can Nous have been\nproduced by the Propator, when he holds the chief and primary place of\nthat hidden and invisible affection which is within Him? By this\naffection sense is produced, and Ennœa, and Enthymesis, and other things\nwhich are simply synonyms for Nous himself. As I have said already, they\nare merely certain definite exercises in thought of that very power\nconcerning some particular subject. We understand the [several] terms\naccording to their\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3043\"\u003e3043\u003c/sup\u003e\nlength and breadth of meaning, not according to any [fundamental] change\n[of signification]; and the [various exercises of thought] are limited by\n[the same sphere of] knowledge, and are expressed together by [the same]\nterm, the [very same] sense remaining within, and creating, and\nadministering, and freely governing even by its own power, and as it\npleases, the things which have been previously mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p3\"\u003e2. For the first exercise of that [power] respecting\nanything, is styled Ennœa; but when it continues, and gathers strength,\nand takes possession of the whole soul, it is called Enthymesis. This\nEnthymesis, again, when it exercises itself a long time on the same\npoint, and has, as it were, been proved, is named Sensation. And this\nSensation, when it is much developed, becomes Counsel. The increase,\nagain, and greatly developed exercise of this Counsel becomes the\nExamination of thought (Judgment); and this remaining in the mind is most\nproperly termed Logos (reason), from which the spoken Logos (word)\nproceeds.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3044\"\u003e3044\u003c/sup\u003e But all the [exercises of thought] which have been mentioned are\n[fundamentally] one and the same, receiving their origin from Nous, and\nobtaining [different] appellation according to their increase. Just as\nthe human body, which is at one time young, then in the prime of life,\nand then old, has received [different] appellations according to its\nincrease and continuance, but not according to any change of substance,\nor on account of any [real] loss of body, so is it with those [mental\nexercises]. For, when one [mentally] contemplates anything, he also\nthinks of it; and when he thinks of it, he has also knowledge regarding\nit; and when he knows it, he also considers it; and when he considers it,\nhe also mentally handles it; and when he mentally handles it, he also\nspeaks of it. But, as I have already said, it is Nous who governs all\nthese [mental processes], while He is himself invisible, and utters\nspeech of himself by means of those processes which have been mentioned,\nas it were by rays [proceeding from Him], but He himself is not sent\nforth by any other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p5\"\u003e3. These things may properly be said to hold good in\nmen, since they are compound by nature, and consist of a body and a soul.\nBut those who affirm that Ennœa was sent forth from God, and Nous from\nEnnœa, and then, in succession, Logos from these, are, in the first\nplace, to be blamed as having improperly used these productions; and, in\nthe next place, as describing the affections, and passions, and mental\ntendencies of men, while they [thus prove themselves]\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_374.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xiv-Page_374\" n=\"374\" /\u003e\n\nignorant of God. By their manner of speaking, they ascribe those\nthings which apply to men to the Father of all, whom they also declare to\nbe unknown to all; and they deny that He himself made the world, to guard\nagainst attributing want of power\n\nignorant of God. By their manner of speaking, they ascribe those\nthings which apply to men to the Father of all, whom they also declare to\nbe unknown to all; and they deny that He himself made the world, to guard\nagainst attributing want of power\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3045\"\u003e3045\u003c/sup\u003e to Him; while, at the same time, they endow Him\nwith human affections and passions. But if they had known the Scriptures,\nand been taught by the truth, they would have known, beyond doubt, that\nGod is not as men are; and that His thoughts are not like the thoughts of\nmen.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3046\"\u003e3046\u003c/sup\u003e For the Father of all is at a vast distance\nfrom those affections and passions which operate among men. He is a\nsimple, uncompounded Being, without diverse members,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3047\"\u003e3047\u003c/sup\u003e and\naltogether like, and equal to himself, since He is wholly understanding,\nand wholly spirit, and wholly thought, and wholly intelligence, and\nwholly reason, and wholly hearing, and wholly seeing, and wholly light,\nand the whole source of all that is good—even as the religious\nand pious are wont to speak concerning God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p9\"\u003e4. He is, however, above [all] these properties, and\ntherefore indescribable. For He may well and properly be called an\nUnderstanding which comprehends all things, but He is not [on that\naccount] like the understanding of men; and He may most properly be\ntermed Light, but He is nothing like that light with which we are\nacquainted. And so, in all other particulars, the Father of all is in no\ndegree similar to human weakness. He is spoken of in these terms\naccording to the love [we bear Him]; but in point of greatness, our\nthoughts regarding Him transcend these expressions. If then, even in the\ncase of human beings, understanding itself does not arise from emission,\nnor is that intelligence which produces other things separated from the\nliving man, while its motions and affections come into manifestation,\nmuch more will the mind of God, who is all understanding, never by any\nmeans be separated from Himself; nor can anything\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3048\"\u003e3048\u003c/sup\u003e [in His\ncase] be produced as if by a different Being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p11\"\u003e5. For if He produced intelligence, then He who did\nthus produce intelligence must be understood, in accordance with their\nviews, as a compound and corporeal Being; so that God, who sent forth\n[the intelligence referred to], is separate from it, and the intelligence\nwhich was sent forth separate [from Him]. But if they affirm that\nintelligence was sent forth from intelligence, they then cut asunder the\nintelligence of God, and divide it into parts. And whither has it gone?\nWhence was it sent forth? For whatever is sent forth from any place,\npasses of necessity into some other. But what existence was there more\nancient than the intelligence of God, into which they maintain it was\nsent forth? And what a vast region that must have been which was capable\nof receiving and containing the intelligence of God! If, however, they\naffirm [that this emission took place] just as a ray proceeds from the\nsun, then, as the subjacent air which receives the ray must have had an\nexistence prior to it, so [by such reasoning] they will indicate that\nthere was something in existence, into which the intelligence of God was\nsent forth, capable of containing it, and more ancient than itself.\nFollowing upon this, we must hold that, as we see the sun, which is less\nthan all things, sending forth rays from himself to a great distance, so\nlikewise we say that the Propator sent forth a ray beyond, and to a great\ndistance from, Himself. But what can be conceived of beyond, or at a\ndistance from, God, into which He sent forth this ray?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p12\"\u003e6. If, again, they affirm that that [intelligence] was\nnot sent forth beyond the Father, but within the Father Himself, then, in\nthe first place, it becomes superfluous to say that it was sent forth at\nall. For how could it have been sent forth if it continued within the\nFather? For an emission is the manifestation of that which is emitted,\nbeyond him who emits it. In the next place, this [intelligence] being\nsent forth, both that Logos who springs from Him will still be within the\nFather, as will also be the future emissions proceeding from Logos.\nThese, then, cannot in such a case be ignorant of the Father, since they\nare within Him; nor, being all equally surrounded by the Father, can any\none know Him less [than another] according to the descending order of\ntheir emission. And all of them must also in an equal measure continue\nimpassible, since they exist in the bosom of their Father, and none of\nthem can ever sink into a state of degeneracy or degradation. For with\nthe Father there is no degeneracy, unless perchance as in a great circle\na smaller is contained, and within this one again a smaller; or unless\nthey affirm of the Father, that, after the manner of a sphere or a\nsquare, He contains within Himself on all sides the likeness of a sphere,\nor the production of the rest of the Æons in the form of a square, each\none of these being surrounded by that one who is above him in greatness,\nand surrounding in turn that one who is after him in smallness; and that\non this account, the smallest and the last of all, having its place in\nthe centre, and thus being far separated from the Father, was really\nignorant of the Propator. But if they maintain any such hypothesis, they\nmust shut up their Bythus within\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_375.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xiv-Page_375\" n=\"375\" /\u003e\n\na definite form and space,\nwhile He both surrounds others, and is surrounded by them; for they must\nof necessity acknowledge that there is something outside of Him which\nsurrounds Him. And none the less will the talk concerning those that\ncontain, and those that are contained, flow on into infinitude; and all\n[the Æons] will most clearly appear to be bodies enclosed [by one\nanother].\n\na definite form and space,\nwhile He both surrounds others, and is surrounded by them; for they must\nof necessity acknowledge that there is something outside of Him which\nsurrounds Him.

Further, they must also confess either that He is\nmere vacuity, or that the entire universe is within Him; and in that case\nall will in like degree partake of the Father. Just as, if one forms\ncircles in water, or round or square figures, all these will equally\npartake of water; just as those, again, which are framed in the air, must\nnecessarily partake of air, and those which [are formed] in light, of\nlight; so must those also who are within Him all equally partake of the\nFather, ignorance having no place among them. Where, then, is this\npartaking of the Father who fills [all things]? If, indeed, He has filled\n[all things], there will be no ignorance among them. On this ground,\nthen, their work of [supposed] degeneracy is brought to nothing, and the\nproduction of matter with the formation of the rest of the world; which\nthings they maintain to have derived their substance from passion and\nignorance. If, on the other hand, they acknowledge that He is vacuity,\nthen they fall into the greatest blasphemy; they deny His spiritual\nnature. For how can He be a spiritual being, who cannot fill even those\nthings which are within Him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p14\"\u003e8. Now, these remarks which have been made concerning\nthe emission of intelligence are in like manner applicable in opposition\nto those who belong to the school of Basilides, as well as in opposition\nto the rest of the Gnostics, from whom these also (the Valentinians) have\nadopted the ideas about emissions, and were refuted in the first book.\nBut I have now plainly shown that the first production of Nous, that is,\nof the intelligence they speak of, is an untenable and impossible\nopinion. And let us see how the matter stands with respect to the rest\n[of the Æons]. For they maintain that Logos and Zoe were sent forth by\nhim (i.e., Nous) as fashioners of this Pleroma; while they conceive of an\nemission of Logos, that is, the Word after the analogy of human feelings,\nand rashly form conjectures respecting God, as if they had discovered\nsomething wonderful in their assertion that Logos was I produced by Nous.\nAll indeed have a clear perception that this may be logically affirmed\nwith respect to men.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3049\"\u003e3049\u003c/sup\u003e But in Him who is God over all, since\nHe is all Nous, and all Logos, as I have said before, and has in Himself\nnothing more ancient or late than another, and nothing at variance with\nanother, but continues altogether equal, and similar, and homogeneous,\nthere is no longer ground for conceiving of such production in the order\nwhich has been mentioned. Just as he does not err who declares that God\nis all vision, and all hearing (for in what manner He sees, in that also\nHe hears; and in what manner He hears, in that also He sees), so also he\nwho affirms that He is all intelligence, and all word, and that, in\nwhatever respect He is intelligence, in that also He is word, and that\nthis Nous is His Logos, will still indeed have only an inadequate\nconception of the Father of all, but will entertain far more becoming\n[thoughts regarding Him] than do those who transfer the generation of the\nword to which men gave utterance to the eternal Word of God, assigning a\nbeginning and course of production [to Him], even as they do to their own\nword. And in what respect will the Word of God—yea, rather God\nHimself, since He is the Word—differ from the word of men, if He\nfollows the same order and process of generation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p16\"\u003e9. They have fallen into error, too, respecting Zoe, by\nmaintaining that she was produced in the sixth place, when it behoved her\nto take precedence of all [the rest], since God is life, and\nincorruption, and truth. And these and such like attributes have not been\nproduced according to a gradual scale of descent, but they are names of\nthose perfections which always exist in God, so far as it is possible and\nproper for men to hear and to speak of God. For with the name of God the\nfollowing words will harmonize: intelligence, word, life, incorruption,\ntruth, wisdom, goodness, and such like. And neither can any one maintain\nthat intelligence is more ancient than life, for intelligence itself is\nlife; nor that life is later than intelligence, so that He who is the\nintellect of all, that is God, should at one time have been destitute of\nlife. But if they affirm that life was indeed [previously] in the Father,\nbut was produced in the sixth place in order that the Word might live,\nsurely it ought long before, [according to such reasoning,] to have been\nsent forth, in the fourth place, that Nous might have life; and still\nfurther, even before Him, [it should have been] with Bythus, that their\nBythus might live. For to reckon Sige, indeed, along with their Propator,\nand to assign her to Him as His consort, while they do not join Zoe to\nthe number,—is not this to surpass all other madness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xiv-p17\"\u003e10. Again, as to the second production which proceeds\nfrom these [Æons who have been mentioned],—that, namely, of Homo\nand Ecclesia,—their very fathers, falsely styled Gnostics, strive\namong themselves, each one seeking to make good his own opinions, and\nthus convicting themselves of being wicked thieves.\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_376.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xiv-Page_376\" n=\"376\" /\u003e\n\nThey\nmaintain that it is more suitable to [the theory of] production—\nas being, in fact, truth-like—that the Word was produced by man,\nand not man by the Word; and that man existed prior to the Word, and that\nthis is really He who is God over all.

After these he next introduces\na second generation of gods, and the creation of the world; then he\nnarrates the formation of mankind by the second order of the gods. These\nmen (the heretics), adopting this fable as their own, have ranged their\nopinions round it, as if by a sort of natural process, changing only the\nnames of the things referred to, and setting forth the very same\nbeginning of the generation of all things, and their production. In place\nof Night and Silence they substitute Bythus and Sige; instead of Chaos,\nthey put Nous; and for Love (by whom, says the comic poet, all other\nthings were set in order) they have brought forward the Word; while for\nthe primary and greatest gods they have formed the Æons; and in place of\nthe secondary gods, they tell us of that creation by their mother which\nis outside of the Pleroma, calling it the second Ogdoad. They proclaim to\nus, like the writer referred to, that from this (Ogdoad) came the\ncreation of the world and the formation of man, maintaining that they\nalone are acquainted with these ineffable and unknown mysteries. Those\nthings which are everywhere acted in the theatres by comedians with the\nclearest voices they transfer to their own system, teaching them\nundoubtedly through means of the same arguments, and merely changing the\nnames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xv-p4\"\u003e2. And not only are they convicted of bringing forward,\nas if their own [original ideas], those things which are to be found\namong the comic poets, but they also bring together the things which have\nbeen said by all those who were ignorant of God, and who are termed\nphilosophers; and sewing together, as it were, a motley garment out of a\nheap of miserable rags, they have, by their subtle manner of expression,\nfurnished themselves with a cloak which is really not their own. They do,\nit is true, introduce a new kind of doctrine, inasmuch as by a new sort\nof art it has been substituted [for the old]. Yet it is in reality both\nold and useless, since these very opinions have been sewed together out\nof ancient dogmas redolent of ignorance and irreligion. For instance,\nThales\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3053\"\u003e3053\u003c/sup\u003e of Miletus affirmed that water was\nthe generative and initial principle of all things.

The poet\nHomer,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3054\"\u003e3054\u003c/sup\u003e again, held the opinion that Oceanus, along\nwith mother Tethys, was the origin of the gods: this idea these men have\ntransferred to Bythus and Sige. Anaximander laid it down that infinitude is the\nfirst principle of all things, having seminally in itself the generation\nof them all, and from this he declares the immense worlds [which exist]\nwere formed: this, too, they have dressed up anew, and referred to Bythus\nand their Æons. Anaxagoras, again, who has\nalso been surnamed “Atheist,” gave it as his opinion that\nanimals were formed from seeds falling down from heaven upon earth. This\nthought, too, these men have transferred to “the seed” of\ntheir Mother, which they maintain to be themselves; thus acknowledging at\nonce, in the judgment of such as are possessed of sense, that they\nthemselves are the offspring of the irreligious Anaxagoras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xv-p7\"\u003e3.

This opinion, too, that they hold the Creator formed\nthe world out of previously existing matter, both Anaxagoras, Empedocles,\nand Plato expressed before them; as, forsooth, we learn they also do\nunder the inspiration of their Mother. Then again, as to the opinion that\neverything of necessity passes away to those things out of which they\nmaintain it was also formed, and that God is the slave of this necessity,\nso that He cannot impart immortality to what is mortal, or bestow\nincorruption on what is corruptible, but every one passes into a\nsubstance similar in nature to itself, both those who are named Stoics\nfrom the portico (\u003cspan class=\"Greek\" id=\"ix.iii.xv-p9.1\" lang=\"EL\"\u003eστοὰ\u003c/span\u003e), and indeed\nall that are ignorant of God, poets and historians alike, make the same\naffirmation.), and indeed\nall that are ignorant of God, poets and historians alike, make the same\naffirmation.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3056\"\u003e3056\u003c/sup\u003e Those\n[heretics] who hold the same [system of] infidelity have ascribed, no\ndoubt, their own proper region to spiritual beings,—that, namely,\nwhich is within the Pleroma, but to animal beings the intermediate space,\nwhile to corporeal they assign that which is material. And they assert\nthat God Himself can do no otherwise, but that every one of the\n[different kinds of substance] mentioned passes away to those things\nwhich are of the same nature [with itself].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xv-p11\"\u003e5. Moreover, as to their saying that the Saviour was\nformed out of all the Æons, by every one of them depositing, so to\nspeak, in Him his own special flower, they bring forward nothing new that\nmay not be found in the Pandora of Hesiod. For what he says respecting\nher, these men insinuate concerning the Saviour, bringing Him before us\nas Pandoros (All-gifted), as if each of the Æons had bestowed on Him\nwhat He possessed in the greatest perfection. Again, their opinion as to\nthe indifference of [eating of] meats and other actions, and as to their\nthinking that, from the nobility of their nature, they can in no degree\nat all contract pollution, whatever they eat or perform, they have\nderived it from the Cynics, since they do in fact belong to the same\nsociety as do these [philosophers]. They also strive to transfer to [the\ntreatment of matters of] faith that hairsplitting and subtle mode of\nhandling questions which is, in fact, a copying of Aristotle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xv-p12\"\u003e6. Again, as to the desire\nthey exhibit to refer this whole universe to numbers, they have learned\nit from the Pythagoreans. For these were the first who set forth numbers\nas the initial principle of all things, and [described] that initial\nprinciple of theirs as being both equal and unequal, out of which [two\nproperties] they conceived that both things sensible\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3057\"\u003e3057\u003c/sup\u003e and\nimmaterial derived their origin. And [they held] that one set of first\nprinciples\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3058\"\u003e3058\u003c/sup\u003e gave\nrise to the matter [of things], and another to their form. They affirm\nthat from these first principles all things have been made, just as a\nstatue is of its metal and its special form. Now, the heretics have\nadapted this to the things which are outside of the Pleroma.

If they\nknew it, then the descent of the Saviour into this world was superfluous.\nFor why [in that case] did He descend? Was it that He might bring that\ntruth which was [already] known to the knowledge of those who knew it?\nIf, on the other hand, these men did \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e know it, then how is it\nthat, while you express yourselves in the same terms as do those who knew\nnot the truth, ye boast that yourselves alone possess that knowledge\nwhich is above all things, although they who are ignorant of God\n[likewise] possess it?

Thus, then, by a complete perversion\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3060\"\u003e3060\u003c/sup\u003e of language, they style ignorance\nof the truth knowledge: and Paul well says [of them,] that [they make use\nof] “novelties of words of false knowledge.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3061\"\u003e3061\u003c/sup\u003e For that knowledge of theirs is truly found\nto be false. If, however, taking an impudent course with respect to these\npoints, they declare that men indeed did not know the truth, but that\ntheir Mother,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3062\"\u003e3062\u003c/sup\u003e the seed\nof the Father, proclaimed the mysteries of truth through such men, even\nas also through the prophets, while the Demiurge was ignorant [of the\nproceeding], then I answer, in the first place, that the things which\nwere predicted were not of such a nature as to be intelligible to no one;\nfor the men themselves knew what they were saying, as did also their\ndisciples, and those again succeeded these. And, in the next place, if\neither the Mother or her seed knew and proclaimed those things which were\nof the truth (and the Father\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3063\"\u003e3063\u003c/sup\u003e is truth), then on their theory the Saviour spoke falsely when He\nsaid, “No one knoweth the Father but the Son,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3064\"\u003e3064\u003c/sup\u003e unless indeed they maintain that their seed or\nMother is \u003ci\u003eNo-one\u003c/i\u003e..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xv-p22\"\u003e8. Thus far, then, by means of [ascribing to their\nÆons] human feelings, and by the fact that they largely coincide in\ntheir language with many of those who are ignorant of God, they have been\nseen plausibly drawing a certain number away [from the truth]. They lead\nthem on by the use of those [expressions] with which they have been\nfamiliar, to that sort of discourse which treats of all things, setting\nforth the production of the Word of God, and of Zoe, and of Nous, and\nbringing into the world, as it were, the [successive] emanations of the\nDeity. The views, again, which they propound, without either plausibility\nor parade, are simply lies from beginning to end. Just as those who, in\norder to lure and capture any kind of animals, place their accustomed\nfood before them, gradually drawing them on by means of the familiar\naliment, until at length they seize it, but, when they have taken them\ncaptive, they subject them to the bitterest of bondage, and drag them\nalong with violence whithersoever they please; so also do these men\ngradually and gently persuading [others], by means of their plausible\nspeeches, to accept of the emission which has been mentioned, then bring\nforward things which are not consistent, and forms of the remaining\nemissions which are not such as might have been expected. They declare,\nfor instance, that [ten]\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3065\"\u003e3065\u003c/sup\u003e Æons were sent\nforth by Logos and Zoe, while from Anthropos and Ecclesia there proceeded\ntwelve, although they have neither proof, nor testimony, nor probability,\nnor anything whatever of such a nature [to support these assertions]; and\nwith equal folly and audacity do they wish it to be believed that from\nLogos and Zoe, being Æons, were sent forth Bythus and Mixis, Ageratos\nand Henosis, Autophyes and Hedone, Acinetos and Syncrasis, Monogenes and\nMacaria. Moreover, [as they affirm,] there were sent forth, in a similar\nway, from Anthropos and Ecclesia, being Æons, Paracletus and Pistis,\nPatricos and Elpis, Metricos and Agape, Ainos and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus\nand Macariotes, Theletos and Sophia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xv-p24\"\u003e9.

[I have also detailed\ntheir views] respecting Christ, whom they describe as having been\nproduced subsequently to all these, and also regarding Soter, who,\n[according to them,] derived his being from those Æons who were formed\nwithin the Pleroma.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3066\"\u003e3066\u003c/sup\u003e But I have of necessity mentioned their\nnames at present, that from these the absurdity of their falsehood may be\nmade manifest, and also the confused nature of the nomenclature they have\ndevised.

And, in the first place,\nlet them tell us the reason of the production of the Æons being of such\na kind that they do not come in contact with any of those things which\nbelong to creation. For they maintain that those things [above] were not\nmade on account of creation, but creation on account of them; and that\nthe former are not images of the latter, but the latter of the former.\nAs, therefore, they render a reason for the images, by saying that the\nmonth has thirty days on account of the thirty Æons, and the day twelve\nhours, and the year twelve months, on account of the twelve Æons which\nare within the Pleroma, with other such nonsense of the same kind, let\nthem now tell us also the reason for that production of the Æons, why it\nwas of such a nature, for what reason the first and first-begotten\n\u003ci\u003eOgdoad\u003c/i\u003e was sent forth, and not a Pentad, or a Triad, or a\nSeptenad, or any one of those which are defined by a different number?\nMoreover, how did it come to pass, that from Logos and Zoe were sent\nforth ten Æons, and neither more nor less; while again from Anthropos\nand Ecclesia proceeded twelve, although these might have been either more\nor less numerous? was sent forth, and not a Pentad, or a Triad, or a\nSeptenad, or any one of those which are defined by a different number?\nMoreover, how did it come to pass, that from Logos and Zoe were sent\nforth ten Æons, and neither more nor less; while again from Anthropos\nand Ecclesia proceeded twelve, although these might have been either more\nor less numerous?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xvi-p2\"\u003e2. And then, again, with reference to the entire\nPleroma, what reason is there that it should be divided into these three\n—an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad—and not into some\nother number different from these? Moreover, with respect to the division\nitself, why has it been made into \u003ci\u003ethree\u003c/i\u003e parts, and not into four,\nor five, or six, or into some other number among those which have no\nconnection with such numbers parts, and not into four,\nor five, or six, or into some other number among those which have no\nconnection with such numbers\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3068\"\u003e3068\u003c/sup\u003e as belong to creation? For they\ndescribe those [Æons above] as being more ancient than these [created\nthings below], and it behoves them to possess their principle [of being]\nin themselves, one which existed before creation, and not after the\npattern of creation, all exactly agreeing as to the point.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3069\"\u003e3069\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xvi-p5\"\u003e3. The account which we give of creation is one\nharmonious with that regular order [of things prevailing in the world],\nfor this scheme of ours is adapted to the\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3070\"\u003e3070\u003c/sup\u003e things\nwhich have [actually] been made; but it is a matter of necessity that\nthey, being unable to assign any reason belonging to the things\nthemselves, with regard to those beings that existed before [creation],\nand were perfected by themselves, should fall into the greatest\nperplexity. For, as to the points on which they interrogate us as knowing\nnothing of creation, they themselves, when questioned in turn respecting\nthe Pleroma, either make mention of mere human feelings, or have recourse\nto that sort of speech which bears only upon that harmony observable in\ncreation, improperly giving us replies concerning things which are\nsecondary, and not concerning those which, as they maintain, are primary.\nFor we do not question them concerning that harmony which belongs to\ncreation, nor concerning human feelings; but because they must\nacknowledge, as to their octiform, deciform, and duodeciform Pleroma (the\nimage of which they declare creation to be), that their Father formed it\nof that figure vainly and thoughtlessly, and must ascribe to Him\ndeformity, if He made anything without a reason. Or, again, if they\ndeclare that the Pleroma was so produced in accordance with the foresight\nof the Father, for the sake of creation, as if He had thus symmetrically\narranged its very essence, then it follows that the Pleroma can no longer\nbe regarded as having been formed on its own account, but for the sake of\nthat [creation] which was to be its image as possessing its likeness\n(just as the clay model is not moulded for its own sake, but for the sake\nof the statue in brass, or gold, or silver about to be formed), then\ncreation will have greater honour than the Pleroma, if, for its sake,\nthose things [above] were produced.\u003c/p\u003e",

Or was it\nafter the manner of germination, as branches from a tree? And were they\nof the same substance with those who produced them, or did they derive\ntheir substance from some other [kind of] substance? Also, were they\nproduced at the same time, so as to be contemporaries; or after a certain\norder, so that some of them were older, and others younger? And, again,\nare they uncompounded and uniform, and altogether equal and similar among\nthemselves, as spirit and light are produced; or are they compounded and\ndifferent, unlike [to each other] in their members?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xviii-p4\"\u003e3. If each of them was produced, after the manner of\nmen, actually and according to its own generation, then either those thus\ngenerated by the Father will be of the same substance with Him, and\nsimilar to their Author; or if\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3074\"\u003e3074\u003c/sup\u003e they appear dissimilar, then it must of\nnecessity be acknowledged that they are [formed] of some different\nsubstance. Now, if the beings generated by the Father be similar to their\nAuthor, then those who have been produced must remain for ever\nimpassible, even as is He who produced them; but if, on the other hand,\nthey are of a different substance, which is capable of passion, then\nwhence came this dissimilar substance to find a place within the\nincorruptible Pleroma? Further, too, according to this principle, each\none of them must be understood as being completely separated from every\nother, even as men are not mixed with nor united the one to the other,\nbut each having a distinct shape of his own, and a definite sphere of\naction, while each one of them, too, is formed of a particular size,\n—qualities characteristic of a body, and not of a spirit. Let them\ntherefore no longer speak of the Pleroma as being \u003ci\u003espiritual\u003c/i\u003e, or of\nthemselves as “spiritual,” if indeed their Æons sit feasting\nwith the Father, just as if they were men, and He Himself is of such a\nconfiguration as those reveal Him to be who were produced by Him., or of\nthemselves as “spiritual,” if indeed their Æons sit feasting\nwith the Father, just as if they were men, and He Himself is of such a\nconfiguration as those reveal Him to be who were produced by Him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xviii-p6\"\u003e4. If,\nagain, the Æons were derived from Logos, Logos from Nous, and Nous from\nBythus, just as lights are kindled from a light—as, for example,\ntorches are from a torch—then they may no doubt differ in\ngeneration and size from one another; but since they are of the same\nsubstance with the Author of their production, they must either all\nremain for ever impassible, or their Father Himself must participate in\npassion. For the torch which has been kindled subsequently cannot be\npossessed of a different kind of light from that which preceded it.\nWherefore also their lights, when blended in one, return to the original\nidentity, since that one light is then formed which has existed even from\nthe beginning. But we cannot speak, with respect to light itself, of some\npart being more recent in its origin, and another being more ancient (for\nthe whole is but one light); nor can we so speak even in regard to those\ntorches which have received the light (for these are all contemporary as\nrespects their material substance, for the substance of torches is one\nand the same), but simply as to [the time of] its being kindled, since\none was lighted a little while ago, and another has just now been\nkindled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xviii-p7\"\u003e5. The defect, therefore, of that passion which has\nregard to ignorance, will either attach alike to their whole Pleroma,\nsince [all its members] are of the same substance; and the Propator will\nshare in this defect of ignorance—that is, will be ignorant of\nHimself; or, on the other hand, all those lights which are within the\nPleroma will alike remain for ever impassible. Whence, then, comes the\npassion of the youngest Æon, if the light of the Father is that from\nwhich all other lights have been formed, and which is by nature\nimpassible? And how can one Æon be spoken of as either younger or older\namong themselves, since there is but one light in the entire Pleroma? And\nif any one calls them stars, they will all nevertheless appear to\nparticipate in the same nature.

If\ntherefore He exists in passion and ignorance, so must also those Æons\nwho have been generated by Him.

If, again, they declare that their Æons were sent\nforth just as rays are from the sun, then, since all are of the same\nsubstance and sprung from the same source, all must either be capable of\npassion along with Him who produced them, or all will remain impassible\nfor ever. For they can no longer maintain that, of beings so produced,\nsome are impassible and others passible. If, then, they declare all\nimpassible, they do themselves destroy their own argument. For how could\nthe youngest Æon have suffered passion if all were impassible? If, on\nthe other hand, they declare that all partook of this passion, as indeed\nsome of them venture to maintain, then, inasmuch as it originated with\nLogos,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3076\"\u003e3076\u003c/sup\u003e but flowed onwards to Sophia, they will thus be convicted of\ntracing back the passion to Logos, who is the\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3077\"\u003e3077\u003c/sup\u003e Nous of this Propator, and so acknowledging the Nous of the\nPropator and the Father Himself to have experienced passion. For the\nFather of all is not to be regarded as a kind of compound Being, who can\nbe separated from his Nous (mind), as I have already shown; but Nous is\nthe Father, and the Father Nous. It necessarily follows, therefore, both\nthat he who springs from Him as Logos, or rather that Nous himself, since\nhe is Logos, must be perfect and impassible, and that those productions\nwhich proceed from him, seeing that they are of the same substance with\nhimself, should be perfect and impassible, and should ever remain similar\nto him who produced them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xviii-p13\"\u003e8. It cannot therefore longer be held, as these men\nteach, that Logos, as occupying the third place in generation, was\nignorant of the Father. Such a thing might indeed perhaps be deemed\nprobable in the case of the generation of human beings, inasmuch as these\nfrequently know nothing of their parents; but it is altogether impossible\nin the case of the Logos of the Father. For if, existing in the Father,\nhe knows Him in whom he exists—that is, is not ignorant of\nhimself—then those productions which issue from him being his\npowers (faculties), and always present with him, will not be ignorant of\nhim who emitted them, any more than rays [may be supposed to be] of the\nsun. It is impossible, therefore, that the Sophia (wisdom) of God, she\nwho is within the Pleroma, inasmuch as she has been produced in such a\nmanner, should have fallen under the influence of passion, and conceived\nsuch ignorance. But it is possible that that Sophia (wisdom) who pertains\nto [the scheme] of Valentinus, inasmuch as she is a production of the\ndevil, should fall into every kind of passion, and exhibit the\nprofoundest ignorance. For when they themselves bear testimony concerning\ntheir mother, to the effect that she was the offspring of an erring Æon,\nwe need no longer search for a reason why the sons of such a mother\nshould be ever swimming in the depths of ignorance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xviii-p14\"\u003e9.

But if, at a subsequent period, when He so willed it, He\n\u003ci\u003ecould\u003c/i\u003e take away that ignorance which had increased with the\nsuccessive productions as they followed each other, and thus become\ndeeply seated in the Æons, much more, had He so willed it might He\nformerly have prevented that ignorance, which as yet was not, from coming\ninto existence. take away that ignorance which had increased with the\nsuccessive productions as they followed each other, and thus become\ndeeply seated in the Æons, much more, had He so willed it might He\nformerly have prevented that ignorance, which as yet was not, from coming\ninto existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xviii-p20\"\u003e11. Since therefore, as soon as He so pleased, He did\nbecome known not only to the Æons, but also to these men who lived in\nthese latter times; but, as He did not so please to be known from the\nbeginning, He remained unknown—the cause of ignorance is,\naccording to you, the will of the Father. For if He foreknew that these\nthings would in future happen in such a manner, why then did He not guard\nagainst the ignorance of these beings before it had obtained a place\namong them, rather than afterwards, as if under the influence of\nrepentance, deal with it through the production of Christ? For the\nknowledge which through Christ He conveyed to all, He might long before\nhave imparted through Logos, who was also the first-begotten of\nMonogenes. Or if, knowing them beforehand, He willed that these things\nshould happen [as they have done], then the works of ignorance must\nendure for ever, and never pass away. For the things which have been made\nin accordance with the will of your Propator must continue along with the\nwill of Him who willed them; or if they pass away, the will of Him also\nwho decreed that they should have a being will pass away along with them.\nAnd why did the Æons find rest and attain perfect knowledge through\nlearning [at last] that the Father is altogether\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3082\"\u003e3082\u003c/sup\u003e incomprehensible? They might surely have\npossessed this knowledge before they became involved in passion; for the\ngreatness of the Father did not suffer diminution from the beginning, so\nthat these might\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3083\"\u003e3083\u003c/sup\u003e know that He was altogether\nincomprehensible. For if, on account of His infinite greatness, He\nremained unknown, He ought also on account of His infinite love to have\npreserved those impassible who were produced by Him, since nothing\nhindered, and expediency rather required, that they should have known\nfrom the beginning that the Father was altogether incomprehensible.\u003c/p\u003e",

How then could the Enthymesis separately conceive\npassions, which themselves also were her affections? For affection is\nnecessarily connected with an individual: it cannot come into being or\nexist apart by itself. This opinion [of theirs], however, is not only\nuntenable, but also opposed to that which was spoken by our Lord:\n“Seek, and ye shall find.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3084\"\u003e3084\u003c/sup\u003e For the\nLord renders His disciples perfect by their seeking after and finding the\nFather; but that Christ of theirs, who is above, has rendered them\nperfect, by the fact that He has commanded the Æons not to seek after\nthe Father, persuading them that, though they should labour hard, they\nwould not find Him. And they\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3085\"\u003e3085\u003c/sup\u003e declare that\nthey themselves are perfect, by the fact that they maintain they have\nfound their Bythus; while the Æons [have been made perfect] through\nmeans of this, that He is unsearchable who was inquired after by\nthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xix-p6\"\u003e4. Since, therefore, the Enthymesis herself could not\nexist separately, apart from the Æon, [it is obvious that] they bring\nforward still greater falsehood concerning her passion, when they further\nproceed to divide and separate it from her, while they declare that it\nwas the substance of matter. As if God were not light, and as if no Word\nexisted who could convict them, and overthrow their wickedness. For it is\ncertainly true, that whatsoever the Æon thought, that she also suffered;\nand what she suffered, that she also thought. And her Enthymesis was,\naccording to them, nothing else than the passion of one thinking how she\nmight comprehend the incomprehensible. And thus Enthymesis (thought) was\nthe passion; for she was thinking of things impossible. How then could\naffection and passion be separated and set apart from the Enthymesis, so\nas to become the substance of so vast a material creation, when\nEnthymesis herself was the passion, and the passion Enthymesis? Neither,\ntherefore, can Enthymesis apart from the Æon, nor the affections apart\nfrom Enthymesis, separately possess substance; and thus once more their\nsystem breaks down and is destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xix-p7\"\u003e5. But how did it come to pass that the Æon was both\ndissolved [into her component parts], and became subject to passion? She\nwas undoubtedly of the same substance as the Pleroma; but the entire\nPleroma was of the Father. Now, any substance, when brought in contact\nwith what is of a similar nature, will not be dissolved into nothing, nor\nwill be in danger of perishing, but will rather continue and increase,\nsuch as fire in fire, spirit in spirit, and water in water; but those\nwhich are of a contrary nature to each other do, [when they meet,] suffer\nand are changed and destroyed. And, in like manner, if there had been a\nproduction of light, it would not suffer passion, or recur any danger in\nlight like itself, but would rather glow with the greater brightness, and\nincrease, as the day does from [the increasing brilliance of] the sun;\nfor they maintain that Bythus [himself] was the image of their\nfather\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3086\"\u003e3086\u003c/sup\u003e\n(Sophia). Whatever animals are alien [in habits] and strange to each\nother, or are mutually opposed in nature, fall into danger [on meeting\ntogether], and are destroyed; whereas, on the other hand, those who are\naccustomed to each other, and of a harmonious disposition, suffer no\nperil from being together in the same place, but rather secure both\nsafety and life by such a fact. If, therefore, this Æon was produced by\nthe Pleroma of the same substance as the whole of it, she could never\nhave undergone change, since she was consorting with beings similar to\nand familiar with herself, a spiritual essence among those that were\nspiritual. For fear, terror, passion, dissolution, and such like, may\nperhaps occur through the struggle of contraries among such beings as we\nare, who are possessed of bodies; but among spiritual beings, and those\nthat have the light diffused among them, no such calamities can possibly\nhappen. But these men appear to me to have endowed their Æon with the\n[same sort of] passion as belongs to that character in the comic poet\nMenander,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3087\"\u003e3087\u003c/sup\u003e who was himself deeply in love, but\nan object of hatred [to his beloved].

Moreover, to meditate how to search into [the nature\nof] the perfect Father, and to have a desire to exist within Him, and to\nhave a comprehension of His [greatness], could not entail the stain of\nignorance or passion, and that upon a spiritual Æon; but would rather\n[give rise to] perfection, and impassibility, and truth.

For, that this Æon is superior to\nthemselves, and of greater antiquity, they themselves acknowledge,\naccording to their own system, when they affirm that they are the fruit\nof the Enthymesis of that Æon who suffered passion, so that this Æon is\nthe father of their mother, that is, their own grandfather. And to them,\nthe later grandchildren, the search after the Father brings, as they\nmaintain, truth, and perfection, and establishment, and deliverance from\nunstable matter, and reconciliation to the Father; but on their\ngrandfather this same search entailed ignorance, and passion, and terror,\nand perplexity, from which [disturbances] they also declare that the\nsubstance of matter was formed. To say, therefore, that the search after\nand investigation of the perfect Father, and the desire for communion and\nunion with Him, were things quite beneficial to them, but to an Æon,\nfrom whom also they derive their origin, these things were the cause of\ndissolution and destruction, how can such assertions be otherwise viewed\nthan as totally inconsistent, foolish, and irrational?

This is to affirm, in the first place, that those angels who wait\nupon their Saviour are imperfect, and without figure or form; if indeed\nthat which was conceived according to their appearance was generated any\nsuch kind of being [as has been described].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xx-p2\"\u003e2. Then, in the next place, as to their saying that the\nCreator was ignorant of that deposit of seed which took place into him,\nand again, of that impartation of seed which was made by him to man,\ntheir words are futile and vain, and are in no way susceptible of proof.\nFor how could he have been ignorant of it, if that seed had possessed any\nsubstance and peculiar properties? If, on the other hand, it was without\nsubstance and without quality, and so was really nothing, then, as a\nmatter of course, he was ignorant of it. For those things which have a\ncertain motion of their own, and quality, either of heat, or swiftness,\nor sweetness, or which differ from others in brilliance, do not escape\nthe notice even of men, since they mingle in the sphere of human action:\nfar less can they [be hidden from] God, the Maker of this universe. With\nreason, however, [is it said, that] their seed was not known to Him,\nsince it is without any quality of general utility, and without the\nsubstance requisite for any action, and is, in fact, a pure nonentity. It\nreally seems to me, that, with a view to such opinions, the Lord\nexpressed Himself thus: “For every idle word that men speak, they\nshall give account on the day of judgment.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3088\"\u003e3088\u003c/sup\u003e For all teachers of a like character to these, who fill\nmen’s ears with idle talk, shall, when they stand at the throne of\njudgment, render an account for those things which they have vainly\nimagined and falsely uttered against the Lord, proceeding, as they have\ndone, to such a height of audacity as to declare of themselves that, on\naccount of the substance of their seed, they are acquainted with the\nspiritual Pleroma, because that man who dwells within reveals to them the\ntrue Father; for the animal nature required\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3089\"\u003e3089\u003c/sup\u003e to be\ndisciplined by means of the senses.

And that they are the\ntruly “spiritual,” inasmuch as a certain particle of the\nFather of the universe has been deposited in their souls, since,\naccording to their assertions, they have souls formed of the same\nsubstance as the Demiurge himself, yet that he, although he received from\nthe Mother, once for all, the whole [of the divine] seed, and possessed\nit in himself, still remained of an animal nature, and had not the\nslightest understanding of those things which are above, which things\nthey boast that they themselves understand, while they are still on\nearth;—does not this crown all possible absurdity? For to imagine\nthat the very same seed conveyed knowledge and perfection to the souls of\nthese men, while it only gave rise to ignorance in the God who made them,\nis an opinion that can be held only by those utterly frantic, and totally\ndestitute of common sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xx-p6\"\u003e4. Further, it is also a most absurd and groundless\nthing for them to say that the seed was, by being thus deposited, reduced\nto form and increased, and so was prepared for all the reception of\nperfect rationality. For there will be in it an admixture of matter\n—that substance which they hold to have been derived from\nignorance and defect; [and this will prove itself] more apt and useful\nthan was the light of their Father, if indeed, when born, according to\nthe contemplation of that [light], it was without form or figure, but\nderived from this [matter], form, and appearance, and increase, and\nperfection. For if that light which proceeds from the Pleroma was the\ncause to a spiritual being that it possessed neither form, nor\nappearance, nor its own special magnitude, while its descent to this\nworld added all these things to it, and brought it to perfection, then a\nsojourn here (which they also term darkness) would seem much more\nefficacious and useful than was the light of their Father. But how can it\nbe regarded as other than ridiculous, to affirm that their mother ran the\nrisk of being almost extinguished in matter, and was almost on the point\nof being destroyed by it, had she not then with difficulty stretched\nherself outwards, and leaped, [as it were,] out of herself, receiving\nassistance from the Father; but that her seed increased in this same\nmatter, and received a form, and was made fit for the reception of\nperfect rationality; and this, too, while “bubbling up” among\nsubstances dissimilar and unfamiliar to itself, according to their own\ndeclaration that the earthly is opposed to the spiritual, and the\nspiritual to the earthly? How, then, could “a little\nparticle,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3090\"\u003e3090\u003c/sup\u003e\nas they say, increase, and receive shape, and reach perfection, in the\nmidst of substances contrary to and unfamiliar to itself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xx-p8\"\u003e5. But further, and in addition to what has been said,\nthe question occurs, Did their mother, when she beheld the angels, bring\nforth the seed all at once, or only one by one [in succession]? If she\nbrought forth the whole simultaneously and at once, that which was thus\nproduced cannot now be of an infantile character: its descent, therefore,\ninto those men who now exist must be superfluous.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3091\"\u003e3091\u003c/sup\u003e But if one by\none, then she did not form her conception according to the figure of\nthose angels whom she beheld; for, contemplating them all together, and\nonce for all, so as to conceive by them, she ought to have brought forth\nonce for all the offspring of those from whose forms she had once for all\nconceived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xx-p10\"\u003e6. Why was it, too, that, beholding the angels along\nwith the Saviour, she did indeed conceive \u003ci\u003etheir\u003c/i\u003e images, but not\nthat of the  images, but not\nthat of the \u003ci\u003eSaviour\u003c/i\u003e, who is far more beautiful than they? Did He\nnot please her; and did she not, on that account, conceive after His\nlikeness?, who is far more beautiful than they? Did He\nnot please her; and did she not, on that account, conceive after His\nlikeness?\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3092\"\u003e3092\u003c/sup\u003e How was it, too, that the Demiurge,\nwhom they can call an animal being, having, as they maintain, his own\nspecial magnitude and figure, was produced perfect as respects his\nsubstance; while that which is spiritual, which also ought to be more\neffective than that which is animal, was sent forth imperfect, and he\nrequired to descend into a soul, that in it he might obtain form, and\nthus becoming perfect, might be rendered fit for the reception of perfect\nreason? If, then, he obtains form in mere earthly and animal men, he can\nno longer be said to be after the likeness of angels whom they call\nlights, but [after the likeness] of those men who are here below. For he\nwill not possess in that case the likeness and appearance of angels, but\nof those souls in whom also he receives shape; just as water when poured\ninto a vessel takes the form of that vessel, and if on any occasion it\nhappens to congeal in it, it will acquire the form of the vessel in which\nit has thus been frozen, since souls themselves possess the figure\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3093\"\u003e3093\u003c/sup\u003e of the body [in which they dwell]; for they\nthemselves have been adapted to the vessel [in which they exist], as I\nhave said before. If, then, that seed [referred to] is here solidified\nand formed into a definite shape, it will possess the figure of a man.\nand not the form of the angels. How is it possible, therefore, that that\nseed should be after images of the angels, seeing it has obtained a form\nafter the likeness of men? Why, again, since it was of a spiritual\nnature, had it any need of descending into flesh? For what is carnal\nstands in need of that which is spiritual, if indeed\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_387.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xx-Page_387\" n=\"387\" /\u003e\n\nit is\nto be saved, that in it it may be sanctified and cleared from all\nimpurity, and that what is mortal may be swallowed up by\nimmortality;\n\nit is\nto be saved, that in it it may be sanctified and cleared from all\nimpurity, and that what is mortal may be swallowed up by\nimmortality;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3094\"\u003e3094\u003c/sup\u003e but that which is\nspiritual has no need whatever of those things which are here below.

Still more manifestly is that talk of theirs\nconcerning their seed proved to be false, and that in a way which must be\nevident to every one, by the fact that they declare those souls which\nhave received seed from the Mother to be superior to all others;\nwherefore also they have been honoured by the Demiurge, and constituted\nprinces, and kings, and priests. For if this were true, the high priest\nCaiaphas, and Annas, and the rest of the chief priests, and doctors of\nthe law, and rulers of the people, would have been the first to believe\nin the Lord, agreeing as they did with respect\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3095\"\u003e3095\u003c/sup\u003e to that relationship; and even before them should\nhave been Herod the king.

As to the point, then, that their system is weak and\nuntenable as well as utterly chimerical, enough has been said. For it is\nnot needful, to use a common proverb, that one should drink up the ocean\nwho wishes to learn that its water is salt. But, just as in the case of a\nstatue which is made of clay, but coloured on the outside that it may be\nthought to be of gold, while it really is of clay, any one who takes out\nof it a small particle, and thus laying it open reveals the clay, will\nset free those who seek the truth from a false opinion; in the same way\nhave I (by exposing not a small part only, but the several heads of their\nsystem which are of the greatest importance) shown to as many as do not\nwish wittingly to be led astray, what is wicked, deceitful, seductive,\nand pernicious, connected with the school of the Valentinians, and all\nthose other heretics who promulgate\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3097\"\u003e3097\u003c/sup\u003e wicked opinions respecting the Demiurge, that is,\nthe Fashioner and Former of this universe, and who is in fact the only\ntrue God—exhibiting, [as I have done,] how easily their views are\noverthrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xx-p19\"\u003e9. For who that has any intelligence, and possesses\nonly a small proportion of truth, can tolerate them, when they affirm\nthat there is another god above the Creator; and that there is another\nMonogenes as well as another Word of God, whom also they describe as\nhaving been produced in [a state of] degeneracy; and another Christ, whom\nthey assert to have been formed, along with the Holy Spirit, later than\nthe rest of the Æons; and another Saviour, who, they say, did not\nproceed from the Father of all, but was a kind of joint production of\nthose Æons who were formed in [a state of] degeneracy, and that He was\nproduced of necessity on account of this very degeneracy? It is thus\ntheir opinion that, unless the Æons had been in a state of ignorance and\ndegeneracy, neither Christ, nor the Holy Spirit, nor Horos, nor the\nSaviour, nor the angels, nor their Mother, nor her seed, nor the rest of\nthe fabric of the world, would have been produced at all; but the\nuniverse would have been a desert, and destitute of the many good things\nwhich exist in it. They are therefore not only chargeable with impiety\nagainst the Creator, declaring Him the fruit of a defect, but also\nagainst Christ and the Holy Spirit, affirming that they were produced on\naccount of that defect; and, in like manner, that the Saviour [was\nproduced] subsequently to [the existence of] that defect. And who will\ntolerate the remainder of their vain talk, which they cunningly endeavour\nto accommodate to the parables, and have in this way plunged both\nthemselves, and those who give credit to them, in the profoundest depths\nof impiety?\u003c/p\u003e",

For that\nÆon, whose type they declare Judas to be, after being separated from her\nEnthymesis, was restored or recalled [to her former position]; but Judas\nwas deprived [of his office], and cast out, while Matthias was ordained\nin his place, according to what is written, “And his bishopric let\nanother take.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3099\"\u003e3099\u003c/sup\u003e They ought therefore to maintain that the\ntwelfth Æon was cast out of the Pleroma, and that another was produced,\nor sent forth to fill her place; if, that is to say, she is pointed at in\nJudas. Moreover, they tell us that it was the Æon herself who suffered,\nbut Judas was the betrayer, [and not the sufferer.] Even they themselves\nacknowledge that it was the suffering Christ, and not Judas, who came to\n[the endurance of] passion. How, then, could Judas, the betrayer of Him\nwho had to suffer for our salvation, be the type and image of that Æon\nwho suffered?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxi-p5\"\u003e3. But, in truth, the passion of Christ was neither\nsimilar to the passion of the Æon, nor did it take place in similar\ncircumstances. For the Æon underwent a passion of dissolution and\ndestruction, so that she who suffered was in danger also of being\ndestroyed. But the Lord, our Christ, underwent a valid, and not a\nmerely\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3100\"\u003e3100\u003c/sup\u003e accidental passion; not only was He\nHimself not in danger of being destroyed, but He also established fallen\nman\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3101\"\u003e3101\u003c/sup\u003e by His own strength, and recalled him to\nincorruption. The Æon, again, underwent passion while she was seeking\nafter the Father, and was not able to find Him; but the Lord suffered\nthat He might bring those who have wandered from the Father, back to\nknowledge and to His fellowship. The search into the greatness of the\nFather became to her a passion leading to destruction; but the Lord,\nhaving suffered, and bestowing the knowledge of the Father, conferred on\nus salvation. Her passion, as they declare, gave origin to a female\noffspring, weak, infirm, unformed, and ineffective; but His passion gave\nrise to strength and power. For the Lord, through means of suffering,\n“ascending into the lofty place, led captivity captive, gave gifts\nto men,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3102\"\u003e3102\u003c/sup\u003e and conferred on those that believe in Him the power “to\ntread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the\nenemy,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3103\"\u003e3103\u003c/sup\u003e that is, of the leader of apostasy. Our Lord\nalso by His passion destroyed death, and dispersed error, and put an end\nto corruption, and destroyed ignorance, while He manifested life and\nrevealed truth, and bestowed the gift of incorruption. But their Æon,\nwhen she had suffered, established\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3104\"\u003e3104\u003c/sup\u003e ignorance, and brought forth a\nsubstance without shape, out of which all material works have been\nproduced—death, corruption, error, and such like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxi-p11\"\u003e4. Judas, then, the twelfth in order of the disciples,\nwas not a type of the suffering Æon, nor, again, was the passion of the\nLord; for these two things have been shown to be in every respect\nmutually dissimilar and inharmonious. This is the case not only as\nrespects the points which I have already mentioned, but with regard to\nthe very number. For that Judas the traitor is the twelfth in order, is\nagreed upon by all, there being twelve apostles mentioned by name in the\nGospel. But this Æon is not the \u003ci\u003etwelfth\u003c/i\u003e, but the\n, but the\n\u003ci\u003ethirtieth\u003c/i\u003e; for, according to the views under consideration, there\nwere not twelve Æons only produced by the will of the Father, nor was\nshe sent forth the twelfth in order: they reckon her, [on the contrary,]\nas having been produced in the thirtieth place. How, then, can Judas, the\ntwelfth in order, be the type and image of that Æon who occupies the\nthirtieth place?; for, according to the views under consideration, there\nwere not twelve Æons only produced by the will of the Father, nor was\nshe sent forth the twelfth in order: they reckon her, [on the contrary,]\nas having been produced in the thirtieth place.

But if they say that Judas in perishing was the\nimage of her Enthymesis, neither in this way will the image bear any\nanalogy to that truth which [by hypothesis] corresponds to it. For the\nEnthymesis having been separated from the Æon, and itself afterwards\nreceiving a shape from Christ,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3105\"\u003e3105\u003c/sup\u003e then being made a partaker of intelligence by\nthe Saviour, and having formed all things which are outside of the\nPleroma, after the image of those which are within the Pleroma, is said\nat last to have been received by them into the Pleroma, and, according to\n[the principle of] conjunction, to have been united to that Saviour who\nwas formed out of all. But Judas having been once for all cast away,\nnever returns\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_389.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xxi-Page_389\" n=\"389\" /\u003e\n\ninto the number of the disciples; otherwise a\ndifferent person would not have been chosen to fill his place. Besides,\nthe Lord also declared regarding him, “Woe to the man by whom the\nSon of man shall be betrayed;”\n\ninto the number of the disciples; otherwise a\ndifferent person would not have been chosen to fill his place. Besides,\nthe Lord also declared regarding him, “Woe to the man by whom the\nSon of man shall be betrayed;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3106\"\u003e3106\u003c/sup\u003e and,\n“It were better for him if he had never been born;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3107\"\u003e3107\u003c/sup\u003e and he was called the “son of\nperdition”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3108\"\u003e3108\u003c/sup\u003e by Him. If, however, they\nsay that Judas was a type of the Enthymesis, not as separated from the\nÆon, but of the passion entwined with her, neither in this way can the\nnumber twelve be regarded as a [fitting] type of the number three. For in\nthe one case Judas was cast away, and Matthias was ordained instead of\nhim; but in the other case the Æon is said to have been in danger of\ndissolution and destruction, and [there are also] her Enthymesis and\npassion: for they markedly distinguish Enthymesis from the passion; and\nthey represent the Æon as being restored, and Enthymesis as acquiring\nform, but the passion, when separated from these, as becoming matter.\nSince, therefore, there are thus these three, the Æon, her Enthymesis,\nand her passion, Judas and Matthias, being only two, cannot be the types\nof them.\u003c/p\u003e",

For the prophet neither speaks concerning a day which\nincludes the space of twelve hours, nor of a year the length of which is\ntwelve months.

The acceptable year of the\nLord, again, is this present time, in which those who believe Him are\ncalled by Him, and become acceptable to God—that is, the whole\ntime from His advent onwards to the consummation [of all things], during\nwhich He acquires to Himself as fruits [of the scheme of mercy] those who\nare saved. For, according to the phraseology of the prophet, the day of\nretribution follows the [acceptable] year; and the prophet will be proved\nguilty of falsehood if the Lord preached only for a year, and if he\nspeaks of it. For where is the day of retribution? For the year has\npassed, and the day of retribution has not yet come; but He still\n“makes His sun to rise upon the good and upon the evil, and sends\nrain upon the just and unjust.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3123\"\u003e3123\u003c/sup\u003e And the\nrighteous suffer persecution, are afflicted, and are slain, while sinners\nare possessed of abundance, and “drink with the sound of the harp\nand psaltery, but do not regard the works of the Lord.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3124\"\u003e3124\u003c/sup\u003e But, according to the language [used by the\nprophet], they ought to be combined, and the day of retribution to follow\nthe [acceptable] year.

And the time thus referred to\nis not called “a year” only, but is also named “a\nday” both by the prophet and by Paul, of whom the apostle, calling\nto mind the Scripture, says in the Epistle addressed to the Romans,\n“As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we\nare counted as sheep for the slaughter.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3125\"\u003e3125\u003c/sup\u003e But here the expression “all the day long” is put for\nall this time during which we suffer persecution, and are killed as\nsheep.

Their explanation,\ntherefore, both of the year and of the twelfth month has been proved\nfalse, and they ought to reject either their explanation or the Gospel;\notherwise [this unanswerable question forces itself upon them], How is it\npossible that the Lord preached for one year only?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxiii-p14\"\u003e4.

So likewise He was an old man for old men, that He might be a\nperfect Master for all, not merely as respects the setting forth of the\ntruth, but also as regards age, sanctifying at the same time the aged\nalso, and becoming an example to them likewise.

[In speaking thus,]\nthey are forgetful to their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work,\nand robbing Him of that age which is both more necessary and more\nhonourable than any other; that more advanced age, I mean, during which\nalso as a teacher He excelled all others.

But to one who is only thirty years old it would unquestionably\nbe said, “Thou art not yet forty years old.” For those who\nwished to convict Him of falsehood would certainly not extend the number\nof His years far beyond the age which they saw He had attained; but they\nmentioned a period near His real age, whether they had truly ascertained\nthis out of the entry in the public register, or simply made a conjecture\nfrom what they observed that He was above forty years old, and that He\ncertainly was not one of only thirty years of age. For it is altogether\nunreasonable to suppose that they were mistaken by twenty years, when\nthey wished to prove Him younger than the times of Abraham. For what they\nsaw, that they also expressed; and He whom they beheld was not a mere\nphantasm, but an actual being\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3144\"\u003e3144\u003c/sup\u003e of flesh and blood.

If indeed they were to say that\neleven Æons were involved in passion, but the twelfth one was healed, it\nwould then be a plausible thing to say that the woman was a type of\nthese. But since she suffered during eleven years, and [all that time]\nobtained no cure, but was healed in the twelfth year, in what way can she\nbe a type of the twelfth of the Æons, eleven of whom, [according to\nhypothesis,] did not suffer at all, but the twelfth alone participated in\nsuffering?

But they can neither\nadapt to their fictitious system the case of her who was cured after\neighteen years, nor of him who was cured after thirty-eight years. Now,\nit is in every way absurd and inconsistent to declare that the Saviour\npreserved the type in certain cases, while He did not do so in others.\nThe type of the woman, therefore, [with the issue of blood] is shown to\nhave no analogy to their system of Æons.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3150\"\u003e3150\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

If, indeed, the year\nwere divided into thirty parts, and the month into twelve, then a fitting\ntype might be regarded as having been found for their fictitious system.\nBut, on the contrary, as the case really stands, their Pleroma is divided\ninto thirty parts, and a portion of it into twelve; while again the whole\nyear is divided into twelve parts, and a certain portion of it into\nthirty. The Saviour therefore acted unwisely in constituting the month a\ntype of the entire Pleroma, but the year a type only of that Duodecad\nwhich exists in the Pleroma; for it was more fitting to divide the year\ninto thirty parts, even as the whole Pleroma is divided, but the month\ninto twelve, just as the Æons are in their Pleroma. Moreover, they\ndivide the entire Pleroma into three portions,—namely, into an\nOgdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad. But our year is divided into four parts,\n—namely, spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

The lover of truth therefore ought not to be\ndeceived by the interval between each note, nor should he imagine that\none was due to one artist and author, and another to another, nor that\none person fitted the treble, another the bass, and yet another the tenor\nstrings; but he should hold that one and the same person [formed the\nwhole], so as to prove the judgment, goodness, and skill exhibited in the\nwhole work and [specimen of] wisdom. Those, too, who listen to the\nmelody, ought to praise and extol the artist, to admire the tension of\nsome notes, to attend to the softness of others, to catch the sound of\nothers between both these extremes, and to consider the special character\nof others, so as to inquire at what each one aims, and what is the cause\nof their variety, never failing to apply our rule, neither giving up the\n[one\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3198\"\u003e3198\u003c/sup\u003e] artist,\nnor casting off faith in the one God who formed all things, nor\nblaspheming our Creator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxvi-p8\"\u003e3.

Then, again, the\ndwelling-place of birds—of those, I mean, which come to us in\nspring, but fly away again on the approach of autumn—though it is\na matter connected with this world, escapes our knowledge. What\nexplanation, again, can we give of the flow and ebb of the ocean,\nalthough every one admits there must be a certain cause [for these\nphenomena]?

For our tongue, as being\ncarnal, is not sufficient to minister to the rapidity of the human mind,\ninasmuch as that is of a spiritual nature, for which reason our word is\nrestrained\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3222\"\u003e3222\u003c/sup\u003e within us, and is not at once\nexpressed as it has been conceived by the mind, but is uttered by\nsuccessive efforts, just as the tongue is able to serve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxix-p15\"\u003e5. But God being all Mind, and all Logos, both speaks\nexactly what He thinks, and thinks exactly what He speaks. For His\nthought is Logos, and Logos is Mind, and Mind comprehending all things is\nthe Father Himself. He, therefore, who speaks of the mind of God, and\nascribes to it a special origin of its own, declares Him a compound\nBeing, as if God were one thing, and the original Mind another.

Neither\nValentinus, nor Marcion, nor Saturninus, nor Basilides, nor angels, nor\narchangels, nor principalities, nor powers [possess this knowledge], but\nthe Father only who begat, and the Son who was begotten. Since therefore\nHis generation is unspeakable, those who strive to set forth generations\nand productions cannot be in their right mind, inasmuch as they undertake\nto describe things which are indescribable. For that a word is uttered at\nthe bidding of thought and mind, all men indeed well understand. Those,\ntherefore, who have excogitated [the theory of] emissions have not\ndiscovered anything great, or revealed any abstruse mystery, when they\nhave simply transferred what all understand to the only-begotten Word of\nGod; and while they style Him unspeakable and unnameable, they\nnevertheless set forth the production and formation of His first\ngeneration, as if they themselves had assisted at His birth, thus\nassimilating Him to the word of mankind formed by emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxix-p21\"\u003e7. But we shall not be wrong if we affirm the same\nthing also concerning the substance of matter, that God produced it. For\nwe have learned from the Scriptures that God holds the supremacy over all\nthings. But whence or in what way He produced it, neither has Scripture\nanywhere declared; nor does it become us to conjecture, so as, in\naccordance with our own opinions, to form endless conjectures concerning\nGod, but we should leave such knowledge in the hands of God Himself. In\nlike manner, also, we must leave the cause why, while all things were\nmade by God, certain of His creatures sinned and revolted from a state of\nsubmission to God, and others, indeed the great majority, persevered, and\ndo still persevere, in [willing] subjection to Him who formed them, and\nalso of what nature those are who sinned, and of what nature those who\npersevere,—[we must, I say, leave the cause of these things] to\nGod and His Word, to whom alone He said, “Sit at my right hand,\nuntil I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3227\"\u003e3227\u003c/sup\u003e But as for us, we still dwell upon the earth, and have not yet\nsat down upon His throne. For although the Spirit of the Saviour that is\nin Him “searcheth all things, even the deep things of\nGod,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3228\"\u003e3228\u003c/sup\u003e yet as to us “there are\ndiversities of gifts, differences of administrations, and diversities of\noperations;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3229\"\u003e3229\u003c/sup\u003e and we, while upon\nthe earth, as Paul also declares, “know in part, and prophesy in\npart.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3230\"\u003e3230\u003c/sup\u003e Since, therefore, we know but in\npart, we ought to leave all sorts of [difficult] questions in the hands\nof Him who in some measure, [and that only,] bestows grace on us.

And that\nGod foreknew that this would happen, the Scriptures do in like manner\ndemonstrate, since He prepared eternal fire from the beginning for those\nwho were [afterwards] to transgress [His commandments]; but the cause\nitself of the nature of such transgressors neither has any Scripture\ninformed us, nor has an apostle told us, nor has the Lord taught us. It\nbecomes us, therefore, to leave the knowledge of this matter to God, even\nas the Lord does of the day and hour [of judgment], and not to rush to\nsuch an extreme of danger, that we will leave nothing in the hands of\nGod, even though we have received only a measure of grace [from Him in\nthis world].

And then the\ndoctrine concerning the resurrection of bodies which we believe, will\nemerge true and certain [from their system]; since, [as we hold,] God,\nwhen He resuscitates our mortal bodies which preserved righteousness,\nwill render them incorruptible and immortal. For God is superior to\nnature, and has in Himself the disposition [to show kindness], because He\nis good; and the ability to do so, because He is mighty; and the faculty\nof fully carrying out His purpose, because He is rich and perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxx-p8\"\u003e3. But these men are in all points inconsistent with\nthemselves, when they decide that all souls do not enter into the\nintermediate place, but those of the righteous only. For they maintain\nthat, according to nature and substance, three sorts [of being] were\nproduced by the Mother: the first, which proceeded from perplexity, and\nweariness, and fear—that is material substance; the second from\nimpetuosity\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3243\"\u003e3243\u003c/sup\u003e—that is animal substance; but that which she\nbrought forth after the vision of those angels who wait upon Christ, is\nspiritual substance. If, then, that substance\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3244\"\u003e3244\u003c/sup\u003e\nwhich she brought forth will by all means enter into the Pleroma because\nit is spiritual, while that which is material will remain below because\nit is material, and shall be totally consumed by the fire which burns\nwithin it, why should not the whole animal substance go into the\nintermediate place, into which also they send the Demiurge? But what is\nit which shall enter within their Pleroma? For they maintain that souls\nshall continue in the intermediate place, while bodies, because they\npossess material substance, when they have been resolved into matter,\nshall be consumed by that fire which exists in it; but their body being\nthus destroyed, and their soul remaining in the intermediate place, no\npart of man will any longer be left to enter in within the Pleroma. For\nthe intellect of man—his mind, thought, mental intention, and\nsuch like—is nothing else than his soul; but the emotions and\noperations of the soul itself have no substance apart from the soul. What\npart of them, then, will still remain to enter into the Pleroma? For they\nthemselves, in as far as they are souls, remain in the intermediate\nplace; while, in as far as they are body, they will be consumed with the\nrest of matter.\u003c/p\u003e",

What work, then, will they point to as having been\naccomplished through themselves by the Saviour, or by their Mother,\neither greater, or more glorious, or more adorned with wisdom, than those\nwhich have been produced by Him who was the disposer of all around us?\nWhat heavens have they established? what earth have they founded? what\nstars have they called into existence? or what lights of heaven have they\ncaused to shine? within what circles, moreover, have they confined them?\nor, what rains, or frosts, or snows, each suited to the season, and to\nevery special climate, have they brought upon the earth? And again, in\nopposition to these, what heat or dryness have they set over against\nthem? or, what rivers have they made to flow? what fountains have they\nbrought forth? with what flowers and trees have they adorned this\nsublunary world? or, what multitude of animals have they formed, some\nrational, and others irrational, but all adorned with beauty? And who can\nenumerate one by one all the remaining objects which have been\nconstituted by the power of God, and are governed by His wisdom? or who\ncan search out the greatness of that God who made them? And what can be\ntold of those existences which are above heaven, and which do not pass\naway, such as Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, and Powers\ninnumerable? Against what one of these works, then, do they set\nthemselves in opposition? What have they similar to show, as having been\nmade through themselves, or by themselves, since even they too are the\nWorkmanship and creatures of this [Creator]? For whether the Saviour or\ntheir Mother (to use their own expressions, proving them false by means\nof the very terms they themselves employ) used this Being, as they\nmaintain, to make an image of those things which are within the Pleroma,\nand of all those beings which she saw waiting upon the Saviour, she used\nhim (the Demiurge) as being [in a sense] superior to herself, and better\nfitted to accomplish her purpose through his instrumentality; for she\nwould by no means form the images of such important beings through means\nof an inferior, but by a superior, agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxi-p8\"\u003e4. For, [be it observed,] they themselves, according to\ntheir own declarations, were then existing, as a spiritual conception, in\nconsequence of the contemplation of those beings who were arranged as\nsatellites around Pandora.

But\nthe God who, according to them, was produced, while, as they argue,\ninferior to themselves (for they maintain that he is of an animal\nnature), was nevertheless the active agent in all things, efficient, and\nfit for the work to be done, so that by him the images of all things were\nmade; and not only were these things which are seen formed by him, but\nalso all things invisible, Angels, Archangels, Dominations, Powers, and\nVirtues,—[by him, I say,] as being the superior, and capable of\nministering to her desire. But it seems that the Mother made nothing\nwhatever through their instrumentality, as indeed they themselves\nacknowledge; so that one may justly reckon them as having been an\nabortion produced by the painful travail of their Mother. For no\naccoucheurs performed their office upon her, and therefore they were cast\nforth as an abortion, useful for nothing, and formed to accomplish no\nwork of the Mother. And yet they describe themselves as being superior to\nHim by whom so vast and admirable works have been accomplished and\narranged, although by their own reasoning they are found to be so\nwretchedly inferior!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxi-p10\"\u003e5.

Such a man, if any such were found, would justly be regarded\nas imbecile, and not in his right mind. And so should those be judged of\nwho speak of themselves as being spiritual and superior, and of the\nCreator as possessed of an animal nature, and maintain that for this\nreason they will ascend on high, and penetrate within the Pleroma to\ntheir own husbands (for, according to their own statements, they are\nthemselves feminine), but that God [the Creator] is of an inferior\nnature, and therefore remains in the intermediate place, while all the\ntime they bring forward no proofs of these assertions: for the better man\nis shown by his works, and all works have been accomplished by the\nCreator; but they, having nothing worthy of reason to point to as having\nbeen produced by themselves, are\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_405.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xxxi-Page_405\" n=\"405\" /\u003e\n\nlabouring under the\ngreatest and most incurable madness.\n\nlabouring under the\ngreatest and most incurable madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxi-p11\"\u003e6. If, however,\nthey labour to maintain that, while all material things, such as the\nheaven, and the whole world which exists below it, were indeed formed by\nthe Demiurge, yet all things of a more spiritual nature than these,\n—those, namely, which are above the heavens, such as\nPrincipalities, Powers, Angels, Archangels, Dominations, Virtues,—\nwere produced by a spiritual process of birth (which they declare\nthemselves to be), then, in the first place, we prove from the\nauthoritative Scriptures\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3250\"\u003e3250\u003c/sup\u003e that all the things which have been\nmentioned, visible and invisible, have been made by one God. For these\nmen are not more to be depended on than the Scriptures; nor ought we to\ngive up the declarations of the Lord, Moses, and the rest of the\nprophets, who have proclaimed the truth, and give credit to them, who do\nindeed utter nothing of a sensible nature, but rave about untenable\nopinions. And, in the next place, if those things which are above the\nheavens were really made through their instrumentality, then let them\ninform us what is the nature of things invisible, recount the number of\nthe Angels, and the ranks of the Archangels, reveal the mysteries of the\nThrones, and teach us the differences between the Dominations,\nPrincipalities, Powers, and Virtues. But they can say nothing respecting\nthem; therefore these beings were not made by them. If, on the other\nhand, these were made by the Creator, as was really the case, and are of\na spiritual and holy character, then it follows that He who produced\nspiritual beings is not Himself of an animal nature, and thus their\nfearful system of blasphemy is overthrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxi-p13\"\u003e7. For that there are spiritual\ncreatures in the heavens, all the Scriptures loudly proclaim; and Paul\nexpressly testifies that there are spiritual things when he declares that\nhe was caught up into the third heaven,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3251\"\u003e3251\u003c/sup\u003e\nand again, that he was carried away to paradise, and heard unspeakable\nwords which it is not lawful for a man to utter. But what did that profit\nhim, either his entrance into paradise or his assumption into the third\nheaven, since all these things are still but under the power of the\nDemiurge, if, as some venture to maintain, he had already begun\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3252\"\u003e3252\u003c/sup\u003e to be a spectator and a hearer of those mysteries\nwhich are affirmed to be above the Demiurge? For if it is true that he\nwas becoming acquainted with that order of things which is above the\nDemiurge, he would by no means have remained in the regions of the\nDemiurge, and that so as not even thoroughly to explore even these (for,\naccording to their manner of speaking, there still lay before him four\nheavens,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3253\"\u003e3253\u003c/sup\u003e if he were to approach the Demiurge, and thus\nbehold the whole seven lying beneath him); but he might have been\nadmitted, perhaps, into the intermediate place, that is, into the\npresence of the Mother, that he might receive instruction from her as to\nthe things within the Pleroma. For that inner man which was in him, and\nspoke in him, as they say, though invisible, could have attained not only\nto the third heaven, but even as far as the presence of their Mother. For\nif they maintain that they themselves, that is, their [inner] man, at\nonce ascends above the Demiurge, and departs to the Mother, much more\nmust this have occurred to the [inner] man of the apostle; for the\nDemiurge would not have hindered him, being, as they assert, himself\nalready subject to the Saviour. But if he had tried to hinder him, the\neffort would have gone for nothing. For it is not possible that he should\nprove stronger than the providence of the Father, and that when the inner\nman is said to be invisible even to the Demiurge. But since he (Paul) has\ndescribed that assumption of himself up to the third heaven as something\ngreat and pre-eminent, it cannot be that these men ascend above the\nseventh heaven, for they are certainly not superior to the apostle. If\nthey do maintain that they are more excellent than he, let them prove\nthemselves so by their works, for they have never pretended to anything\nlike [what he describes as occurring to himself]. And for this reason he\nadded, “Whether in the body, or whether out of the body, God\nknoweth,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3254\"\u003e3254\u003c/sup\u003e that\nthe body might neither be thought to be a partaker in that vision,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3255\"\u003e3255\u003c/sup\u003e as if it could have participated in those\nthings which it had seen and heard; nor, again, that any one should say\nthat he was not carried higher on account of the weight of the body; but\nit is therefore thus far permitted even without the body to behold\nspiritual mysteries which are the operations of God, who made the heavens\nand the earth, and formed man, and placed him in paradise, so that those\nshould be spectators of them who, like the apostle, have reached a high\ndegree of perfection in the love of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxi-p19\"\u003e8.

But if He really is of an animal nature, then\nlet them inform us by whom spiritual things were made. They have no proof\nwhich they can give that this was done by means of the travail of their\nMother, which they declare themselves to be. For, not to speak of\nspiritual things, these men cannot create even a fly, or a gnat, or any\nother small and insignificant animal, without observing that law by which\nfrom the beginning animals have been and are naturally produced by God\n—through the deposition of seed in those that are of the same\nspecies. Nor was anything formed by the Mother alone; [for] they say that\nthis Demiurge was produced by her, and that \u003ci\u003ehe\u003c/i\u003e was the Lord (the\nauthor) of all creation. And they maintain that he who is the Creator and\nLord of all that has been made is of an animal nature, while they assert\nthat they themselves are spiritual,—they who are neither the\nauthors nor lords of any one work, not only of those things which are\nextraneous to them, but not even of their own bodies!

Justly, therefore, do we convict them of having\ndeparted far and wide from the truth. For if the Saviour formed the\nthings which have been made, by means of him (the Demiurge), he is proved\nin that case not to be inferior but superior to them, since he is found\nto have been the former even of themselves; for they, too, have a place\namong created things. How, then, can it be argued that these men indeed\nare spiritual, but that he by whom they were created is of an animal\nnature? Or, again, if (which is indeed the only true supposition, as I\nhave shown by numerous arguments of the very clearest nature) He (the\nCreator) made all things freely, and by His own power, and arranged and\nfinished them, and His will is the substance\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3257\"\u003e3257\u003c/sup\u003e of all\nthings, then He is discovered to be the one only God who created all\nthings, who alone is Omnipotent, and who is the only Father rounding and\nforming all things, visible and invisible, such as may be perceived by\nour senses and such as cannot, heavenly and earthly, “by the word\nof His power;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3258\"\u003e3258\u003c/sup\u003e and He has fitted and\narranged all things by His wisdom, while He contains all things, but He\nHimself can be contained by no one: He is the Former, He the Builder, He\nthe Discoverer, He the Creator, He the Lord of all; and there is no one\nbesides Him, or above Him, neither has He any mother, as they falsely\nascribe to Him; nor is there a second God, as Marcion has imagined; nor\nis there a Pleroma of thirty Æons, which has been shown a vain\nsupposition; nor is there any such being as Bythus or Proarche; nor are\nthere a series of heavens; nor is there a virginal light,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3259\"\u003e3259\u003c/sup\u003e nor an unnameable Æon, nor, in fact, any one\nof those things which are madly dreamt of by these, and by all the\nheretics.

We\nmay subvert their doctrine as to transmigration from body to body by this\nfact, that souls remember nothing whatever of the events which took place\nin their previous states of existence. For if they were sent forth with\nthis object, that they should have experience of every kind of action,\nthey must of necessity retain a remembrance of those things which have\nbeen previously accomplished, that they might fill up those in which they\nwere still deficient, and not by always hovering, without intermission,\nround the same pursuits, spend their labour wretchedly in vain (for the\nmere union of a body [with a soul] could not altogether extinguish the\nmemory and contemplation of those things which had formerly been\nexperienced\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3281\"\u003e3281\u003c/sup\u003e), and especially as they came [into the world] for this very\npurpose.

For if that which\nis seen only for a very brief space of time, or has been conceived of\nsimply in a phantasm, and by the soul alone, through means of a dream, is\nremembered after she has mingled again with the body, and been dispersed\nthrough all the members, much more would she remember those things in\nconnection with which she stayed during so long a time, even throughout\nthe whole period of a bypast life.\n\nmany of these, she also communicates them to the body; and as it\nhappens that, when one awakes, perhaps after a long time, he relates what\nhe saw in a dream, so also would he undoubtedly remember those things\nwhich he did before he came into this particular body.

With reference to these objections, Plato, that\nancient Athenian, who also was the first\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3282\"\u003e3282\u003c/sup\u003e to introduce this\nopinion, when he could not set them aside, invented the [notion of] a cup\nof oblivion, imagining that in this way he would escape this sort of\ndifficulty. He attempted no kind of proof [of his supposition], but\nsimply replied dogmatically [to the objection in question], that when\nsouls enter into this life, they are caused to drink of oblivion by that\ndemon who watches their entrance [into the world], before they effect an\nentrance into the bodies [assigned them]. It escaped him, that [by\nspeaking thus] he fell into another greater perplexity. For if the cup of\noblivion, after it has been drunk, can obliterate the memory of all the\ndeeds that have been done, how, O Plato, dost thou obtain the knowledge\nof this fact (since thy soul is now in the body), that, before it entered\ninto the body, it was made to drink by the demon a drug which caused\noblivion? For if thou hast a remembrance of the demon, and the cup, and\nthe entrance [into life], thou oughtest also to be acquainted with other\nthings; but if, on the other hand, thou art ignorant of them, then there\nis no truth in the story of the demon, nor in the cup of oblivion\nprepared with art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxiv-p5\"\u003e3. In opposition, again, to those who affirm that the\nbody itself is the drug of oblivion, this observation may be made: How,\nthen, does it come to pass, that whatsoever the soul sees by her own\ninstrumentality, both in dreams and by reflection or earnest mental\nexertion, while the body is passive, she remembers, and reports to her\nneighbours? But, again, if the body itself were [the cause of] oblivion,\nthen the soul, as existing in the body, could not remember even those\nthings which were perceived long ago either by means of the eyes or the\nears; but, as soon as the eye was turned from the things looked at, the\nmemory of them also would undoubtedly be destroyed. For the soul, as\nexisting in the very [cause of] oblivion, could have no knowledge of\nanything else than that only which it saw at the present moment. How,\ntoo, could it become acquainted with divine things, and retain a\nremembrance of them while existing in the body, since, as they maintain,\nthe body itself is [the cause of] oblivion? But the prophets also, when\nthey were upon the earth, remembered likewise, on their returning to\ntheir ordinary state of mind,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3283\"\u003e3283\u003c/sup\u003e whatever things they\nspiritually saw or heard in visions of heavenly objects, and related them\nto others. The body, therefore, does not cause the soul to forget those\nthings which have been spiritually witnessed; but the soul teaches the\nbody, and shares with it the spiritual vision which it has enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxiv-p7\"\u003e4. For the body is not possessed of greater power than\nthe soul, since indeed the former is inspired, and vivified, and\nincreased, and held together by the latter; but the soul possesses\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3284\"\u003e3284\u003c/sup\u003e and rules over the body. It is doubtless\nretarded in its velocity, just in the exact proportion in which the body\nshares in its motion; but it never loses the knowledge which properly\nbelongs to it. For the body may be compared to an instrument; but the\nsoul is possessed of the reason of an artist. As, therefore, the artist\nfinds the idea of a work to spring up rapidly in his mind, but can only\ncarry it out slowly by means of an instrument, owing to the want of\nperfect pliability in the matter acted upon, and thus the rapidity of his\nmental operation, being blended with the slow action of the instrument,\ngives rise to a moderate kind of movement [towards the end contemplated];\nso also the soul, by being mixed up with the body belonging to it, is in\na certain measure impeded, its rapidity being blended with the\nbody’s slowness. Yet it does not lose altogether its own peculiar\npowers; but while, as it were, sharing life with the body, it does not\nitself cease to live. Thus, too, while communicating other things to the\nbody, it neither loses the knowledge of them, nor the memory of those\nthings which have been witnessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxiv-p9\"\u003e5. If, therefore, the soul remembers nothing\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3285\"\u003e3285\u003c/sup\u003e of what took place in a former state of existence,\nbut has a perception of those things which are here, it follows that she\nnever existed in other bodies, nor did things of which she has no\nknowledge, nor [once] knew things which she cannot [now mentally]\ncontemplate. But, as each one of us receives his body through the skilful\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_411.html\" id=\"ix.iii.xxxiv-Page_411\" n=\"411\" /\u003e\n\nworking of God, so does he also possess his soul.

In this account He states\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3288\"\u003e3288\u003c/sup\u003e that Dives knew Lazarus after death, and\nAbraham in like manner, and that each one of these persons continued in\nhis own proper position, and that [Dives] requested Lazarus to be sent to\nrelieve him—[Lazarus], on whom he did not [formerly] bestow even\nthe crumbs [which fell] from his table. [He tells us] also of the answer\ngiven by Abraham, who was acquainted not only with what respected\nhimself, but Dives also, and who enjoined those who did not wish to come\ninto that place of torment to believe Moses and the prophets, and to\nreceive\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3289\"\u003e3289\u003c/sup\u003e the preaching of Him who\nwas\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3290\"\u003e3290\u003c/sup\u003e to rise again from the dead. By these\nthings, then, it is plainly declared that souls continue to exist, that\nthey do not pass from body to body, that they possess the form of a man,\nso that they may be recognised, and retain the memory of things in this\nworld; moreover, that the gift of prophecy was possessed by Abraham, and\nthat each class [of souls] receives a habitation such as it has deserved,\neven before the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxv-p6\"\u003e2. But if any persons at this point maintain that those\nsouls, which only began a little while ago to exist, cannot endure for\nany length of time; but that they must, on the one hand, either be\nunborn, in order that they may be immortal, or if they have had a\nbeginning in the way of generation, that they should die with the body\nitself—let them learn that God alone, who is Lord of all, is\nwithout beginning and without end, being truly and for ever the same, and\nalways remaining the same unchangeable Being. But all things which\nproceed from Him, whatsoever have been made, and are made, do indeed\nreceive their own beginning of generation, and on this account are\ninferior to Him who formed them, inasmuch as they are not unbegotten.\nNevertheless they endure, and extend their existence into a long series\nof ages in accordance with the will of God their Creator; so that He\ngrants them that they should be thus formed at the beginning, and that\nthey should so exist afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iii.xxxv-p7\"\u003e3. For as the heaven which is above us, the firmament,\nthe sun, the moon, the rest of the stars, and all their grandeur,\nalthough they had no previous existence, were called into being, and\ncontinue throughout a long course of time according to the will of God,\nso also any one who thinks thus respecting souls and spirits, and, in\nfact, respecting all created things, will not by any means go far astray,\ninasmuch as all things that have been made had a beginning when they were\nformed, but endure as long as God wills that they should have an\nexistence and continuance. The prophetic Spirit bears testimony to these\nopinions, when He declares, “For He spake, and they were made; He\ncommanded, and they were created: He hath established them for ever, yea,\nforever and ever.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3291\"\u003e3291\u003c/sup\u003e And again, He thus\nspeaks respecting the salvation of man: “He asked life of Thee, and\nThou gavest him length of days for ever and ever;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3292\"\u003e3292\u003c/sup\u003e indicating that it is the Father of all who imparts continuance\nfor ever and ever on those who are saved.

When God therefore bestows life and perpetual\nduration, it comes to pass that even souls which did not previously exist\nshould henceforth endure [for ever], since God has both willed that they\nshould exist, and should continue in existence. For the will of God ought\nto govern and rule in all things, while all other things give way to Him,\nare in subjection, and devoted to His service. Thus far, then, let me\nspeak concerning the creation and the continued duration of the soul.\u003c/p\u003e",

For [they maintain] that the apostles intermingled the things of\nthe law with the words of the Saviour; and that not the apostles alone,\nbut even the Lord Himself, spoke as at one time from the Demiurge, at\nanother from the intermediate place, and yet again from the Pleroma, but\nthat they themselves, indubitably, unsulliedly, and purely, have\nknowledge of the hidden mystery: this is, indeed, to blaspheme their\nCreator after a most impudent manner!

For they were desirous\nthat these men should be very perfect and blameless in all things, whom\nalso they were leaving behind as their successors, delivering up their\nown place of government to these men; which men, if they discharged their\nfunctions honestly, would be a great boon [to the Church], but if they\nshould fall away, the direst calamity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.iv-p2\"\u003e2.

The blessed apostles, then, having\nfounded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the\noffice of the episcopate. Of this Linus, Paul makes mention in the\nEpistles to Timothy. To him succeeded Anacletus; and after him, in the\nthird place from the apostles, Clement was allotted the bishopric. This\nman, as he had seen the blessed apostles, and had been conversant with\nthem, might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing\n[in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone [in\nthis], for there were many still remaining who had received instructions\nfrom the apostles. In the time of this Clement, no small dissension\nhaving occurred among the brethren at Corinth, the Church in Rome\ndespatched a most powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to\npeace, renewing their faith, and declaring the tradition which it had\nlately received from the apostles, proclaiming the one God, omnipotent,\nthe Maker of heaven and earth, the Creator of man, who brought on the\ndeluge, and called Abraham, who led the people from the land of Egypt,\nspake with Moses, set forth the law, sent the prophets, and who has\nprepared fire for the devil and his angels. From this document, whosoever\nchooses to do so, may learn that He, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nwas preached by the Churches, and may also understand the apostolical\ntradition of the Church, since this Epistle is of older date than these\nmen who are now propagating falsehood, and who conjure into existence\nanother god beyond the Creator and the Maker of all existing things. To\nthis Clement there succeeded Evaristus. Alexander followed Evaristus;\nthen, sixth from the apostles, Sixtus was appointed; after him,\nTelesphorus, who was gloriously martyred; then Hyginus; after him, Pius;\nthen after him, Anicetus. Soter having succeeded Anicetus, Eleutherius\ndoes now, in the twelfth place from the apostles, hold the inheritance of\nthe episcopate. In this order, and by this succession, the ecclesiastical\ntradition from the apostles, and the preaching of the truth, have come\ndown to us. And this is most abundant proof that there is one and the\nsame vivifying faith, which has been preserved in the Church from the\napostles until now, and handed down in truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.iv-p5\"\u003e4. But Polycarp also was\nnot only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen\nChrist, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the Church\nin Smyrna, whom I also saw in my early youth, for he tarried [on earth] a\nvery long time, and, when a very old man, gloriously and most nobly\nsuffering martyrdom,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3314\"\u003e3314\u003c/sup\u003e departed this life, having\nalways taught the things which he had learned from the apostles, and\nwhich the Church has handed down, and which alone are true. To these\nthings all the Asiatic Churches testify, as do also those men who have\nsucceeded Polycarp down to the present time,—a man who was of\nmuch greater weight, and a more stedfast witness of truth, than\nValentinus, and Marcion, and the rest of the heretics. He it was who,\ncoming to Rome in the time of Anicetus caused many to turn away from the\naforesaid heretics to the Church of God, proclaiming that he had received\nthis one and sole truth from the apostles,—that, namely, which is\nhanded down by the Church.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3315\"\u003e3315\u003c/sup\u003e There are\nalso those who heard from him that John, the disciple of the Lord, going\nto bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving Cerinthus within, rushed out of the\nbath-house without bathing, exclaiming, “Let us fly, lest even the\nbath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is\nwithin.” And Polycarp himself replied to Marcion,\nwho met him on one occasion, and said, “Dost thou know me?”\n“I do know thee, the first-born of Satan.” Such was the\nhorror which the apostles and their disciples had against holding even\nverbal communication with any corrupters of the truth; as Paul also says,\n“A man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition,\nreject; knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being\ncondemned of himself.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3316\"\u003e3316\u003c/sup\u003e There is also a very\npowerful\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3317\"\u003e3317\u003c/sup\u003e Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians,\nfrom which those who choose to do so, and are anxious about their\nsalvation, can learn the character of his faith, and the preaching of the\ntruth.

When, however, the\nScripture terms them [gods] which are no gods, it does not, as I have\nalready remarked, declare them as gods in every sense, but with a certain\naddition and signification, by which they are shown to be no gods at all.\nAs with David: “The gods of the heathen are idols of\ndemons;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3341\"\u003e3341\u003c/sup\u003e and, “Ye shall not\nfollow other gods.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3342\"\u003e3342\u003c/sup\u003e For in that he says\n“the gods of the heathen”—but the heathen are\nignorant of the true God—and calls them “other gods,”\nhe bars their claim [to be looked upon] as gods at all.

Jeremiah also says the\nsame: “The gods that have not made the heavens and earth, let them\nperish from the earth which is under the heaven.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3345\"\u003e3345\u003c/sup\u003e For, from the fact of his having subjoined their destruction, he\nshows them to be no gods at all.

And Paul himself\nsays that this is true: “We know that an idol is nothing, and that\nthere is none other God but one. For though there be that are called\ngods, whether in heaven or in earth; yet to us there is but one God, the\nFather, of whom are all things, and we through Him; and one Lord Jesus\nChrist, by whom are all things, and we by Him.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3353\"\u003e3353\u003c/sup\u003e For he has made a distinction, and separated those which\nare indeed called gods, but which are none, from the one God the Father,\nfrom whom are all things, and, he has confessed in the most decided\nmanner in his own person, one Lord Jesus Christ. But in this [clause],\n“whether in heaven or in earth,” he does not speak of the\nformers of the world, as these [teachers] expound it; but his meaning is\nsimilar to that of Moses, when it is said, “Thou shalt not make to\nthyself any image for God, of whatsoever things are in heaven above,\nwhatsoever in the earth beneath, and whatsoever in the waters under the\nearth.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3354\"\u003e3354\u003c/sup\u003e And he does thus explain\nwhat are meant by the things in heaven: “Lest when,” he says,\n“looking towards heaven, and observing the sun, and the moon, and\nthe stars, and all the ornament of heaven, falling into error, thou\nshouldest adore and serve them.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3355\"\u003e3355\u003c/sup\u003e And Moses\nhimself, being a man of God, was indeed given as a god before\nPharaoh;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3356\"\u003e3356\u003c/sup\u003e but he is not properly termed Lord, nor is\ncalled God by the prophets, but is spoken of by the Spirit as\n“Moses, the faithful minister and servant of God,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3357\"\u003e3357\u003c/sup\u003e which also he\nwas.\u003c/p\u003e",

For\nif any one read the passage thus—according to Paul’s\ncustom, as I show elsewhere, and by many examples, that he uses\ntransposition of words—“In whom God,” then pointing\nit off, and making a slight interval, and at the same time read also the\nrest [of the sentence] in one [clause], “hath blinded the minds of\nthem of this world that believe not,” he shall find out the true\n[sense]; that it is contained in the expression, “God hath blinded\nthe minds of the unbelievers of this world.” And this is shown by\nmeans of the little interval [between the clause]. For Paul does not say,\n“the God of this world,” as if recognising any other beyond\nHim; but he confessed God as indeed God. And he says, “the\nunbelievers of this world,” because they shall not inherit the\nfuture age of incorruption. I shall show from Paul himself, how it is\nthat God has blinded the minds of them that believe not, in the course of\nthis work, that we may not just at present distract our mind from the\nmatter in hand, [by wandering] at large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.viii-p3\"\u003e2. From\nmany other instances also, we may discover that the apostle frequently\nuses a transposed order in his sentences, due to the rapidity of his\ndiscourses, and the impetus of the Spirit which is in him. An example\noccurs in the [Epistle] to the Galatians, where he expresses himself as\nfollows: “Wherefore then the law of works?\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3359\"\u003e3359\u003c/sup\u003e It was added, until\nthe seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained\nby angels in the hand of a Mediator.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3360\"\u003e3360\u003c/sup\u003e For the order of the words runs thus: “Wherefore then the\nlaw of works? Ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator, it was added\nuntil the seed should come to whom the promise was made,”—\nman thus asking the question, and the Spirit making answer. And again, in\nthe Second to the Thessalonians, speaking of Antichrist, he says,\n“And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus\nChrist\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3361\"\u003e3361\u003c/sup\u003e shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy\nhim\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3362\"\u003e3362\u003c/sup\u003e with the presence of his coming; [even him] whose coming is after\nthe working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying\nwonders.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3363\"\u003e3363\u003c/sup\u003e Now in these [sentences]\nthe order of the words is this: “And then shall be revealed that\nwicked, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and\nsigns, and lying wonders, whom\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_421.html\" id=\"ix.iv.viii-Page_421\" n=\"421\" /\u003e\n\nthe Lord Jesus shall slay\nwith the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the presence of His\ncoming.” For he does not mean that the coming of the Lord is after\nthe working of Satan; but the coming of the wicked one, whom we also call\nAntichrist. If, then, one does not attend to the [proper] reading [of the\npassage], and if he do not exhibit the intervals of breathing as they\noccur, there shall be not only incongruities, but also, when reading, he\nwill utter blasphemy, as if the advent of the Lord could take place\naccording to the working of Satan.

But they\nare again in error, when saying that the Christ and Saviour from above\nwas not born, but that also, after the baptism of the dispensational\nJesus, he, [the Christ of the Pleroma,] descended upon him as a dove.\nTherefore, according to these men, the angels of the Ogdoad lied, when\nthey said, “For unto you is born this day a Saviour, who is Christ\nthe Lord, in the city of David.” For neither was Christ nor the\nSaviour born at that time, by their account; but it was he, the\ndispensational Jesus, who is of the framer of the world, the [Demiurge],\nand upon whom, after his baptism, that is, after [the lapse of] thirty\nyears, they maintain the Saviour from above descended. But why did [the\nangels] add, “in the city of David,” if they did not proclaim\nthe glad tidings of the fulfilment of God’s promise made to David,\nthat from the fruit of his body there should be an eternal King? For the\nFramer [Demiurge] of the entire universe made promise to David, as David\nhimself declares: “My help is from God, who made heaven and\nearth;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3417\"\u003e3417\u003c/sup\u003e and again: “In His\nhand are the ends of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His.\nFor the sea is His, and He did Himself make it; and His hands founded the\ndry land.

What, then, shall\nhappen to those who have been the authors of so much blasphemy against\ntheir Creator? This identical truth was also what the angels\n[proclaimed]. For when they exclaim, “Glory to God in the highest,\nand in earth peace,” they have glorified with these words Him who\nis the Creator of the highest, that is, of super-celestial things, and\nthe Founder of everything on earth: who has sent to His own handiwork,\nthat is, to men, the blessing of His salvation from heaven.

It is not possible that\nthe Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are.

From which fact, it is evident that the Word, the Artificer of\nall, He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains all things, He who\nwas manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but\nbound together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His\nmanifestation, “Thou that sittest between the cherubim, shine\nforth.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3451\"\u003e3451\u003c/sup\u003e For the cherubim, too, were\nfour-faced, and their faces were images of the dispensation of the Son of\nGod. For, [as\nthe Scripture] says, “The first living creature was like a\nlion,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3452\"\u003e3452\u003c/sup\u003e symbolizing His effectual\nworking, His leadership, and royal power; the second [living creature]\nwas like a calf, signifying [His] sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but\n“the third had, as it were, the face as of a man,”—an\nevident description of His advent as a human being; “the fourth was\nlike a flying eagle,” pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering\nwith His wings over the Church. And therefore the\nGospels are in accord with these things, among which Christ Jesus is\nseated. For that according to John\nrelates His original, effectual, and glorious generation from the Father,\nthus declaring, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was\nwith God, and the Word was God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3453\"\u003e3453\u003c/sup\u003e Also,\n“all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing\nmade.” For this reason, too, is that Gospel full of all confidence,\nfor such is His person.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3454\"\u003e3454\u003c/sup\u003e But that\naccording to Luke, taking up [His] priestly character, commenced with\nZacharias the priest offering sacrifice to God.

Sinning, therefore, in all these particulars,\nagainst the Spirit of God,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3465\"\u003e3465\u003c/sup\u003e they\nfall into the irremissible sin. But those who are from Valentinus, being,\non the other hand, altogether reckless, while they put forth their own\ncompositions, boast that they possess more Gospels than there really are.\nIndeed, they have arrived at such a pitch of audacity, as to entitle\ntheir comparatively recent writing “the Gospel of Truth,”\nthough it agrees in nothing with the Gospels of the Apostles, so that\nthey have really no Gospel which is not full of blasphemy. For if what\nthey have published is the Gospel of truth, and yet is totally unlike\nthose which have been handed down to us from the apostles, any who please\nmay learn, as is shown from the Scriptures themselves, that that which\nhas been handed down from the apostles can no longer be reckoned the\nGospel of truth. But that these Gospels alone are true and reliable, and\nadmit neither an increase nor diminution of the aforesaid number, I have\nproved by so many and such [arguments]. For, since God made all things in\ndue proportion and adaptation, it was fit also that the outward aspect of\nthe Gospel should be well arranged and harmonized. The opinion of those\nmen, therefore, who handed the Gospel down to us, having been\ninvestigated, from their very fountainheads, let us proceed also to the\nremaining apostles, and inquire into their doctrine with regard to God;\nthen, in due course we shall listen to the very words of the Lord.\u003c/p\u003e",

Wherefore neither do these men themselves know the\ntruth; but since such was their opinion regarding God, they had just\nreceived doctrine as they were able to hear it. According to this manner\nof speaking, therefore, the rule of truth can be with nobody; but all\nlearners will ascribe this practice to all [teachers], that just as every\nperson thought, and as far as his capability extended, so was also the\nlanguage addressed to him. But the advent of the Lord will appear\nsuperfluous and useless, if He did indeed come intending to tolerate and\nto preserve each man’s idea regarding God rooted in him from of\nold. Besides this, also, it was a much heavier task, that He whom the\nJews had seen as a man, and had fastened to the cross, should be preached\nas Christ the Son of God, their eternal King. Since this, however, was\nso, they certainly did not speak to them in accordance with their old\nbelief. For they, who told them to their face that they were the slayers\nof the Lord, would themselves also much more boldly preach that Father\nwho is above the Demiurge, and not what each individual bid himself\nbelieve [respecting God]; and the sin was much less, if indeed they had\nnot fastened to the cross the superior Saviour (to whom it behoved them\nto ascend), since He was impassible. For, as they did not speak to the\nGentiles in compliance with their notions, but told them with boldness\nthat their gods were no gods, but the idols of demons; so would they in\nlike manner have preached to the Jews, if they had known another greater\nor more perfect Father, not nourishing nor strengthening the untrue\nopinion of these men regarding God. Moreover, while destroying the error\nof the Gentiles, and bearing them away from their gods, they did not\ncertainly induce another error upon them; but, removing those which were\nno gods, they pointed out Him who alone was God and the true Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xiii-p37\"\u003e7.

For this Cornelius was, it is said, “a\ndevout man, and one who feared God with all his house, giving much alms\nto the people, and praying to God always.

The knowledge of the Son was,\nhowever, wanting to him; therefore did [Peter] add, “The word, ye\nknow, which was published throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee,\nafter the baptism which John preached, Jesus of Nazareth, how God\nanointed Him with the Holy Ghost, and with power; who went about doing\ngood, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with\nHim.

And that the whole range of the doctrine of the\napostles proclaimed one and the same God, who removed Abraham, who made\nto him the promise of inheritance, who in due season gave to him the\ncovenant of circumcision, who called his descendants out of Egypt,\npreserved outwardly by circumcision—for he gave it as a sign,\nthat they might not be like the Egyptians—that He was the Maker\nof all things, that He was the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He\nwas the God of glory,—they who wish may learn from the very words\nand acts of the apostles, and may contemplate the fact that this God is\none, above whom is no other. But even if there were another god above\nHim, we should say, upon [instituting] a comparison of the quantity [of\nthe work done by each], that the latter is superior to the former.

And\nwhen he shall have divested his mind of such error, and of that blasphemy\nagainst God which it implies, he will of himself find reason to\nacknowledge that both the Mosaic law and the grace of the new covenant,\nas both fitted for the times [at which they were given], were bestowed by\none and the same God for the benefit of the human race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xiii-p60\"\u003e12. For all those who are of a perverse mind, having\nbeen set against the Mosaic legislation, judging it to be dissimilar and\ncontrary to the doctrine of the Gospel, have not applied themselves to\ninvestigate the causes of the difference of each covenant. Since,\ntherefore, they have been deserted by the paternal love, and puffed up by\nSatan, being brought over to the doctrine of Simon Magus, they have\napostatized in their opinions from Him who is God, and imagined that they\nhave themselves discovered more than the apostles, by finding out another\ngod; and [maintained] that the apostles preached the Gospel still\nsomewhat under the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they themselves\nare purer [in doctrine], and more intelligent, than the apostles.\nWherefore also Marcion and his followers have betaken themselves to\nmutilating the Scriptures, not acknowledging some books\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_435.html\" id=\"ix.iv.xiii-Page_435\" n=\"435\" /\u003e\n\nat\nall; and, curtailing the Gospel according to Luke and the Epistles of\nPaul, they assert that these are alone authentic, which they have\nthemselves thus shortened.

And, indeed, the followers of Marcion do\ndirectly blaspheme the Creator, alleging him to be the creator of evils,\n[but] holding a more tolerable\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3515\"\u003e3515\u003c/sup\u003e theory as to his origin, [and]\nmaintaining that there are two beings, gods by nature, differing from\neach other,—the one being good, but the other evil.

Ignorance of the Scriptures and of the dispensation of God has\nbrought all these things upon them.

But that both the apostles and their disciples thus\ntaught as the Church preaches, and thus teaching were perfected,\nwherefore also they were called away to that which is perfect—\nStephen, teaching these truths, when he was yet on earth, saw the glory\nof God, and Jesus on His right hand, and exclaimed, “Behold, I see\nthe heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of\nGod.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3516\"\u003e3516\u003c/sup\u003e These words he said, and\nwas stoned; and thus did he fulfil the perfect doctrine, copying in every\nrespect the Leader of martyrdom, and praying for those who were slaying\nhim, in these words: “Lord, lay not this sin to their\ncharge.” Thus were they perfected who knew one and the same God,\nwho from beginning to end was present with mankind in the various\ndispensations; as the prophet Hosea declares: “I have filled up\nvisions, and used similitudes by the hands of the prophets.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3517\"\u003e3517\u003c/sup\u003e Those, therefore, who delivered up their souls\nto death for Christ’s Gospel—how could they have spoken to\nmen in accordance with old-established opinion? If this had been the\ncourse adopted by them, they should not have suffered; but inasmuch as\nthey did preach things contrary to those persons who did not assent to\nthe truth, for that reason they suffered. It is evident, therefore, that\nthey did not relinquish the truth, but with all boldness preached to the\nJews and Greeks. To the Jews, indeed, [they proclaimed] that the Jesus\nwho was crucified by them was the Son of God, the Judge of quick and\ndead, and that He has received from His Father an eternal kingdom in\nIsrael, as I have pointed out; but to the Greeks they preached one God,\nwho made all things, and Jesus Christ His Son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xiii-p66\"\u003e14. This is shown in a still clearer light from the\nletter of the apostles, which they forwarded neither to the Jews nor to\nthe Greeks, but to those who from the Gentiles believed in Christ,\nconfirming their faith. For when certain men had come down from Judea to\nAntioch—where also, first of all, the Lord’s disciples were\ncalled Christians, because of their faith in Christ—and sought to\npersuade those who had believed on the Lord to be circumcised, and to\nperform other things after the observance of the law; and when Paul and\nBarnabas had gone up to Jerusalem to the apostles on account of this\nquestion, and the whole Church had convened together, Peter thus\naddressed them: “Men, brethren, ye know how that from the days of\nold God made choice among you, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear\nthe word of the Gospel, and believe. And God, the Searcher of the heart,\nbare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as to us; and put no\ndifference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Now\ntherefore why tempt ye God, to impose a yoke upon the neck of the\ndisciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we\nbelieve that, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to be\nsaved, even as they.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3518\"\u003e3518\u003c/sup\u003e After\nhim James spoke as follows: “Men, brethren, Simon hath declared how\nGod did purpose to take from among the Gentiles a people for His name.\nAnd thus\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3519\"\u003e3519\u003c/sup\u003e do the words of the prophets agree, as it is written, After this\nI will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is\nfallen down; and I will build the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:\nthat the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles,\namong whom my name has been invoked, saith the Lord, doing these\nthings.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3520\"\u003e3520\u003c/sup\u003e Known from eternity is His work to\nGod.

We have sent therefore\nJudas and Silas, that they may declare our opinion by word of mouth. For\nit seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater\nburden than these necessary things; that ye abstain from meats offered to\nidols, and from blood, and from fornication; and whatsoever ye do not\nwish to be done to you, do not ye to others: from which preserving\nyourselves, ye shall do well, walking\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3523\"\u003e3523\u003c/sup\u003e in the Holy Spirit.” From all these\npassages, then, it is evident that they did not teach the existence of\nanother Father, but gave the new covenant of liberty to those who had\nlately believed in God by the Holy Spirit. But they clearly indicated,\nfrom the nature of the point debated by them, as to whether or not it\nwere still necessary to circumcise the disciples, that they had no idea\nof another god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xiii-p73\"\u003e15. Neither [in that case] would they have had such a\ntenor with regard to the first covenant, as not even to have been willing\nto eat with the Gentiles. For even Peter, although he had been sent to\ninstruct them, and had been constrained by a vision to that effect, spake\nnevertheless with not a little hesitation, saying to them: “Ye know\nhow it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company with,\nor to come unto, one of another nation; but God hath shown me that I\nshould not call any man common or unclean. Therefore came I without\ngainsaying;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3524\"\u003e3524\u003c/sup\u003e indicating by these\nwords, that he would not have come to them unless he had been commanded.\nNeither, for a like reason, would he have given them baptism so readily,\nhad he not heard them prophesying when the Holy Ghost rested upon them.\nAnd therefore did he exclaim, “Can any man forbid water, that these\nshould not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as\nwe?”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3525\"\u003e3525\u003c/sup\u003e He persuaded, at the same\ntime, those that were with him, and pointed out that, unless the Holy\nGhost had rested upon them, there might have been some one who would have\nraised objections to their baptism. And the apostles who were with James\nallowed the Gentiles to act freely, yielding us up to the Spirit of God.\nBut they themselves, while knowing the same God, continued in the ancient\nobservances; so that even Peter, fearing also lest he might incur their\nreproof, although formerly eating with the Gentiles, because of the\nvision, and of the Spirit who had rested upon them, yet, when certain\npersons came from James, withdrew himself, and did not eat with them.

But that Paul acceded to [the request of] those who\nsummoned him to the apostles, on account of the question [which had been\nraised], and went up to them, with Barnabas, to Jerusalem, not without\nreason, but that the liberty of the Gentiles might be confirmed by them,\nhe does himself say, in the Epistle to the Galatians: “Then,\nfourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking\nalso Titus. But I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that\nGospel which I preached among the Gentiles.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3537\"\u003e3537\u003c/sup\u003e And again he says, “For an hour we did give place to\nsubjection,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3538\"\u003e3538\u003c/sup\u003e that the truth of the gospel might continue\nwith you.” If, then, any one shall, from the Acts of the Apostles,\ncarefully scrutinize the time concerning which it is written that he went\nup to Jerusalem on account of the forementioned question, he will find\nthose years mentioned by Paul coinciding with it. Thus the statement of\nPaul harmonizes with, and is, as it were, identical with, the testimony\nof Luke regarding the apostles.\u003c/p\u003e",

But that\nthis Luke was inseparable from Paul, and his fellow-labourer in the\nGospel, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as\nbound to do so by the truth itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and\nJohn who was called Mark, had parted company from Paul, and sailed to\nCyprus, “we came to Troas;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3539\"\u003e3539\u003c/sup\u003e and\nwhen Paul had beheld in a dream a man of Macedonia, saying, “Come\ninto Macedonia, Paul, and help us,” “immediately,” he\nsays, “we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, understanding that the\nLord had called us to preach the Gospel unto them. Therefore, sailing\nfrom Troas, we directed our ship’s course towards\nSamothracia.” And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their\njourney as far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address:\n“for, sitting down,” he says, “we spake unto the women\nwho had assembled;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3540\"\u003e3540\u003c/sup\u003e and\ncertain believed, even a great many.

As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he\ncarefully noted them down in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of\nfalsehood or boastfulness, because all these [particulars] proved both\nthat he was senior to all those who now teach otherwise, and that he was\nnot ignorant of the truth.

But that Paul taught with simplicity what he knew,\nnot only to those who were [employed] with him, but to those that heard\nhim, he does himself make manifest. For when the bishops and presbyters\nwho came from Ephesus and the other cities adjoining had assembled in\nMiletus, since he was himself hastening to Jerusalem to observe\nPentecost, after testifying many things to them, and declaring what must\nhappen to him at Jerusalem, he added: “I know that ye shall see my\nface no more. Therefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure\nfrom the blood of all. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the\ncounsel of God. Take heed, therefore, both to yourselves, and to all the\nflock over which the Holy Ghost has placed you as bishops, to rule the\nChurch of the Lord,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3547\"\u003e3547\u003c/sup\u003e which He has acquired for\nHimself through His own blood.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3548\"\u003e3548\u003c/sup\u003e Then,\nreferring to the evil teachers who should arise, he said: “I know\nthat after my departure shall grievous wolves come to you, not sparing\nthe flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse\nthings, to draw away disciples after them.” “I have not\nshunned,” he says, “to declare unto you all the counsel of\nGod.” Thus did the apostles simply, and without respect of persons,\ndeliver to all what they had themselves learned from the Lord. Thus also\ndoes Luke, without respect of persons, deliver to us what he had learned\nfrom them, as he has himself testified, saying, “Even as they\ndelivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and\nministers of the Word.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3549\"\u003e3549\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xv-p14\"\u003e3. Now if any man set Luke aside, as one who did not\nknow the truth, he will, [by so acting,] manifestly reject that Gospel of\nwhich he claims to be a disciple. For through him we have become\nacquainted with very many and important parts of the Gospel; for\ninstance, the generation of John, the history of Zacharias, the coming of\nthe angel to Mary, the exclamation of Elisabeth, the descent of the\nangels to the shepherds, the words spoken by them, the testimony of Anna\nand of Simeon with regard to Christ, and that twelve years of age He was\nleft behind at Jerusalem; also the baptism of John, the number of the\nLord’s years when He was baptized, and that this occurred in the\nfifteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar. And in His office of teacher this is\nwhat He has said to the rich: “Woe unto you that are rich, for ye\nhave received your consolation;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3550\"\u003e3550\u003c/sup\u003e and\n“Woe unto you that are full, for ye shall hunger; and ye who laugh\nnow, for ye shall weep;” and, “Woe unto you when all men\nshall speak well of you: for so did your fathers to the false\nprophets.” All things of the following kind we have known through\nLuke alone (and numerous actions of the Lord we have learned through him,\nwhich also all [the Evangelists] notice): the multitude of fishes which\nPeter’s companions enclosed, when at the Lord’s command they\ncast the nets;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3551\"\u003e3551\u003c/sup\u003e the woman who had suffered for\neighteen years, and was healed on the Sabbath-day;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3552\"\u003e3552\u003c/sup\u003e the man who had the dropsy, whom the Lord made whole on the\nSabbath, and how He did defend Himself for having performed an act of\nhealing on that day; how He taught His disciples not to aspire to the\nuppermost rooms; how we should invite the poor and feeble, who cannot\nrecompense us; the man who knocked during the night to obtain loaves, and\ndid obtain them, because of the urgency of his importunity;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3553\"\u003e3553\u003c/sup\u003e how, when [our Lord] was sitting at meat with\na Pharisee, a woman that was a sinner kissed His feet, and anointed them\nwith ointment, with what the Lord said to Simon on her behalf concerning\nthe two debtors;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3554\"\u003e3554\u003c/sup\u003e also about the parable of that\nrich man who stored up the goods which had accrued to him, to whom it was\nalso said, “In this night they shall demand thy soul from thee;\nwhose then shall those things be which thou hast prepared?”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3555\"\u003e3555\u003c/sup\u003e and similar to this, that of the rich man, who\nwas clothed in purple and who fared sumptuously, and the indigent\nLazarus;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3556\"\u003e3556\u003c/sup\u003e also the answer which He gave to His\ndisciples when they said, “Increase our faith;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3557\"\u003e3557\u003c/sup\u003e also His conversation with Zaccheus the\npublican;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3558\"\u003e3558\u003c/sup\u003e also about\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_439.html\" id=\"ix.iv.xv-Page_439\" n=\"439\" /\u003e\n\nthe Pharisee and the\npublican, who were praying in the temple at the same time;\n\nthe Pharisee and the\npublican, who were praying in the temple at the same time;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3559\"\u003e3559\u003c/sup\u003e also the ten lepers, whom He cleansed in\nthe way simultaneously;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3560\"\u003e3560\u003c/sup\u003e also how He ordered the lame\nand the blind to be gathered to the wedding from the lanes and\nstreets;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3561\"\u003e3561\u003c/sup\u003e also the parable of the judge who feared\nnot God, whom the widow’s importunity led to avenge her cause;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3562\"\u003e3562\u003c/sup\u003e and about the fig-tree in the vineyard which\nproduced no fruit. There are also many other particulars to be found\nmentioned by Luke alone, which are made use of by both Marcion and\nValentinus. And besides all these, [he records] what [Christ] said to His\ndisciples in the way, after the resurrection, and how they recognised Him\nin the breaking of bread.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3563\"\u003e3563\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xv-p29\"\u003e4. It follows then, as of course, that these men must\neither receive the rest of his narrative, or else reject these parts\nalso. For no persons of common sense can permit them to receive some\nthings recounted by Luke as being true, and to set others aside, as if he\nhad not known the truth. And if indeed Marcion’s followers reject\nthese, they will then possess no Gospel; for, curtailing that according\nto Luke, as I have said already, they boast in having the Gospel [in what\nremains]. But the followers of Valentinus must give up their utterly vain\ntalk; for they have taken from that [Gospel] many occasions for their own\nspeculations, to put an evil interpretation upon what he has well said.\nIf, on the other hand, they feel compelled to receive the remaining\nportions also, then, by studying the perfect Gospel, and the doctrine of\nthe apostles, they will find it necessary to repent, that they may be\nsaved from the danger [to which they are exposed].\u003c/p\u003e",

This is a material\ndifference from the received text of the passage: “Every spirit\nthat confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.” The\nVulgate translation and Origen agree with Irenæus, and Tertullian seems\nto recognise both readings (\u003ci\u003eAdv. Marc.\u003c/i\u003e, v. 16). Socrates tells us\n(vii. 32, p. 381) that the passage had been corrupted by those who wished\nto separate the humanity of Christ from His divinity, and that the old\ncopies read, \u003cspan class=\"Greek\" id=\"ix.iv.xvii-p45.2\" lang=\"EL\"\u003eπᾶν πνεῦμα ὃ λύει τὸν ᾽Ιησοῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ ἔστι\u003c/span\u003e, which\nexactly agrees with Origen’s quotation, and very nearly with that\nof Irenæus, now before us. Polycarp (\u003ci\u003eEp.\u003c/i\u003e, c. vii.) seems to\nallude to the passage as we have it now, and so does Ignatius (\u003ci\u003eEp.\nSmyr.\u003c/i\u003e, c. v.).

And although these\nthings are so, some of these men have proceeded to such a degree of\ntemerity, that they even pour contempt upon the martyrs, and vituperate\nthose who are slain on account of the confession of the Lord, and who\nsuffer all things predicted by the Lord, and who in this respect strive\nto follow the footprints of the Lord’s passion, having become\nmartyrs of the suffering One; these we do also enrol with the martyrs\nthemselves.

Therefore, as I have already said, He caused man\n(human nature) to cleave to and to become, one with God. For unless man\nhad overcome the enemy of man, the enemy would not have been legitimately\nvanquished. And again: unless it had been God who had freely given\nsalvation, we could never have possessed it securely. And unless man had\nbeen joined to God, he could never have become a partaker of\nincorruptibility. For it was incumbent upon the Mediator between God and\nmen, by His relationship to both, to bring both to friendship and\nconcord, and present man to God, while He revealed God to man.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3661\"\u003e3661\u003c/sup\u003e For, in\nwhat way could we be partaken of the adoption of sons, unless we had\nreceived from Him through the Son that fellowship which refers to\nHimself, unless His Word, having been made flesh, had entered into\ncommunion with us? Wherefore also He passed through every stage of life,\nrestoring to all communion with God. Those, therefore, who assert that He\nappeared putatively, and was neither born in the flesh nor truly made\nman, are as yet under the old condemnation, holding out patronage to sin;\nfor, by their showing, death has not been vanquished, which\n“reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned\nafter the similitude of Adam’s transgression.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3662\"\u003e3662\u003c/sup\u003e But the law coming, which was given by Moses,\nand testifying of sin that it is a sinner, did truly take away his\n(death’s) kingdom, showing that he was no king, but a robber; and\nit revealed him as a murderer. It laid, however, a weighty burden upon\nman, who had sin in himself, showing that he was liable to death. For as\nthe law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did\nnot destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man.\nFor it behoved Him who was to destroy sin, and redeem man under the power\nof death, that He should Himself be made that very same thing which he\nwas, that is, man; who had been drawn by sin into bondage, but was held\nby death, so that sin should be destroyed by man, and man should go forth\nfrom death. For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally\nmoulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3663\"\u003e3663\u003c/sup\u003e and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of\none man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified\nand receive salvation.

For\nas the first Adam became a vessel in his (Satan’s) possession, whom\nhe did also hold under his power, that is, by bringing sin on him\niniquitously, and under colour of immortality entailing death upon him.\nFor, while promising that they should be as gods, which was in no way\npossible for him to be, he wrought death in them: wherefore he who had\nled man captive, was justly captured in his turn by God; but man, who had\nbeen led captive, was loosed from the bonds of condemnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xxiv-p4\"\u003e2.

For it is too absurd to maintain, that he who was so deeply\ninjured by the enemy, and was the first to suffer captivity, was not\nrescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but that his children were,\n—those whom he had begotten in the same captivity. Neither would\nthe enemy appear to be as yet conquered, if the old spoils remained with\nhim. To give an illustration: If a hostile force had overcome certain\n[enemies], had bound them, and led them away captive, and held them for a\nlong time in servitude, so that they begat children among them; and\nsomebody, compassionating those who had been made slaves, should overcome\nthis same hostile force; he certainly would not act equitably, were he to\nliberate the children of those who had been led captive, from the sway of\nthose who had enslaved their fathers, but should leave these latter, who\nhad suffered the act of capture, subject to their enemies,—those,\ntoo, on whose very account he had proceeded to this retaliation,—\nthe children succeeding to liberty through the avenging of their\nfathers’ cause, but not\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3759\"\u003e3759\u003c/sup\u003e so that their\nfathers, who suffered the act of capture itself, should be left [in\nbondage].

It was for this reason, too, that immediately after\nAdam had transgressed, as the Scripture relates, He pronounced no curse\nagainst Adam personally, but against the ground, in reference to his\nworks, as a certain person among the ancients has observed: “God\ndid indeed transfer the curse to the earth, that it might not remain in\nman.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3760\"\u003e3760\u003c/sup\u003e But man received, as\nthe punishment of his transgression, the toilsome task of tilling the\nearth, and to eat bread in the sweat of his face, and to return to the\ndust from whence he was taken.

But the curse in all its\nfulness fell upon the serpent, which had beguiled them. “And\nGod,” it is declared, “said to the serpent: Because thou hast\ndone this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above all the beasts of\nthe earth.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3761\"\u003e3761\u003c/sup\u003e And this same thing does\nthe Lord also say in the Gospel, to those who are found upon the left\nhand: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my\nFather hath prepared for the devil and his angels;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3762\"\u003e3762\u003c/sup\u003e indicating that eternal fire was not\noriginally prepared for man, but for him who beguiled man, and caused him\nto offend—for him, I say, who is chief of the apostasy, and for\nthose angels who became apostates along with him; which [fire], indeed,\nthey too shall justly feel, who, like him, persevere in works of\nwickedness, without repentance, and without retracing their steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xxiv-p11\"\u003e4.

For what he had planned, that did he also put in practice: he\ntyrannized over and slew him; God subjecting the just to the unjust, that\nthe former might be proved as the just one by the things which he\nsuffered, and the latter detected as the unjust by those which he\nperpetrated. And he was not softened even by this, nor did he stop short\nwith that evil deed; but being asked where his brother was, he said,\n“I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?” extending and\naggravating [his] wickedness by his answer.

The case of Adam, however, had no analogy with this,\nbut was altogether different. For, having been beguiled by another under\nthe pretext of immortality, he is immediately seized with terror, and\nhides himself; not as if he were able to escape from God; but, in a state\nof confusion at having transgressed His command, he feels unworthy to\nappear before and to hold converse with God.

For\n[Adam] showed his repentance by his conduct, through means of the girdle\n[which he used], covering himself with fig-leaves, while there were many\nother leaves, which would have irritated his body in a less degree. He,\nhowever, adopted a dress conformable to his disobedience, being awed by\nthe fear of God; and resisting the erring, the lustful propensity of his\nflesh (since he had lost his natural disposition and child-like mind, and\nhad come to the knowledge of evil things), he girded a bridle of\ncontinence upon himself and his wife, fearing God, and waiting for His\ncoming, and indicating, as it were, some such thing [as follows]:\nInasmuch as, he says, I have by disobedience lost that robe of sanctity\nwhich I had from the Spirit, I do now also acknowledge that I am\ndeserving of a covering of this nature, which affords no gratification,\nbut which gnaws and frets the body. And he would no doubt have retained\nthis clothing for ever, thus humbling himself, if God, who is merciful,\nhad not clothed them with tunics of skins instead of fig-leaves. For this\npurpose, too, He interrogates them, that the blame might light upon the\nwoman; and again, He interrogates her, that she might convey the blame to\nthe serpent. For she related what had occurred. “The\nserpent,” says she, “beguiled me, and I did eat.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3766\"\u003e3766\u003c/sup\u003e But He put no question to the serpent; for He\nknew that he had been the prime mover in the guilty deed; but He\npronounced the curse upon him in the first instance, that it might fall\nupon man with a mitigated rebuke.

And, for this reason\ncertain of the Gentiles, who were less addicted to [sensual] allurements\nand voluptuousness, and were not led away to such a degree of\nsuperstition with regard to idols, being moved, though but slightly, by\nHis providence, were nevertheless convinced that they should call the\nMaker of this universe the Father, who exercises a providence over all\nthings, and arranges the affairs of our world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xxvi-p3\"\u003e2. Again, that they might remove\nthe rebuking and judicial power from the Father, reckoning that as\nunworthy of God, and thinking that they had found out a God both without\nanger and [merely] good, they have alleged that one [God] judges, but\nthat another saves, unconsciously taking away the intelligence and\njustice of both deities. For if the judicial one is not also good, to\nbestow favours upon the deserving, and to direct reproofs against those\nrequiring them, he will appear neither a just nor a wise judge. On the\nother hand, the good God, if he is merely good, and not one who tests\nthose upon whom he shall send his goodness, will be out of the range of\njustice and goodness; and his goodness will seem imperfect, as not saving\nall; [for it should do so,] if it be not accompanied with judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xxvi-p4\"\u003e3. Marcion, therefore, himself, by dividing God into\ntwo, maintaining one to be good and the other judicial, does in fact, on\nboth sides, put an end to deity. For he that is the judicial one, if he\nbe not good, is not God, because he from whom goodness is absent is no\nGod at all; and again, he who is good, if he has no judicial power,\nsuffers the same [loss] as the former, by being deprived of his character\nof deity. And how can they call the Father of all wise, if they do not\nassign to Him a judicial faculty? For if He is wise, He is also one who\ntests [others]; but the judicial power belongs to him who tests, and\njustice follows the judicial faculty, that it may reach a just\nconclusion; justice calls forth judgment, and judgment, when it is\nexecuted with justice, will pass on to wisdom. Therefore the Father will\nexcel in wisdom all human and angelic wisdom, because He is Lord, and\nJudge, and the Just One, and Ruler over all. For He is good, and\nmerciful, and patient, and saves whom He ought: nor does goodness desert\nHim in the exercise of justice,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3788\"\u003e3788\u003c/sup\u003e nor is His wisdom lessened; for He saves\nthose whom He should save, and judges those worthy of judgment. Neither\ndoes He show Himself unmercifully just; for His goodness, no doubt, goes\non before, and takes precedency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xxvi-p6\"\u003e4.

Plato is proved to\nbe more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was\nboth just and good, having power over all things, and Himself executing\njudgment, expressing himself thus, “And God indeed, as He is also\nthe ancient Word, possessing the beginning, the end, and the mean of all\nexisting things, does everything rightly, moving round about them\naccording to their nature; but retributive justice always follows Him\nagainst those who depart from the divine law.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3790\"\u003e3790\u003c/sup\u003e Then, again, he points out that the Maker and Framer of\nthe universe is good. “And to the good,” he says, “no\nenvy ever springs up with regard to anything;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3791\"\u003e3791\u003c/sup\u003e\nthus establishing the goodness of God, as the beginning and the cause of\nthe creation of the world, but not ignorance, nor an erring Æon, nor the\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_460.html\" id=\"ix.iv.xxvi-Page_460\" n=\"460\" /\u003e\n\nconsequence of a defect, nor the Mother weeping and\nlamenting, nor another God or Father.\n\nconsequence of a defect, nor the Mother weeping and\nlamenting, nor another God or Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.iv.xxvi-p11\"\u003e6.

We pray for these things on their behalf,\nloving them better than they seem to love themselves. For our love,\ninasmuch as it is true, is salutary to them, if they will but receive it.\nIt may be compared to a severe remedy, extirpating the proud and\nsloughing flesh of a wound; for it puts an end to their pride and\nhaughtiness. Wherefore it shall not weary us, to endeavour with all our\nmight to stretch out the hand unto them. Over and above what has been\nalready stated, I have deferred to the following book, to adduce the\nwords of the Lord; if, by convincing some among them, through means of\nthe very instruction of Christ, I may succeed in persuading them to\nabandon such error, and to cease from blaspheming their Creator, who is\nboth God alone, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

This, then, is what Irenæus says: (a) “For it is necessary\nfor every Church (that is to say, the faithful from all parts) to meet in\nthis Church, on account of the superior magistracy; in which Church, by\nthose who are from all places, the tradition of the apostles has been\npreserved.” Or, more freely rendered: (b) “On account of the\nchief magistracy\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3796\"\u003e3796\u003c/sup\u003e [of the empire], the faithful from all parts,\nrepresenting every Church, are obliged to resort to Rome, and there to\ncome together; so that [it is the distinction of this Church that], in\nit, the tradition of the apostles has been preserved by Christians\ngathered together out of all the Churches.” Taking the entire\nargument of our author with the context, then, it amounts to this:\n“We must ask, not for local, but universal, testimony. Now, in\nevery Church founded by the apostles has been handed down their\ntraditions; but, as it would be a tedious thing to collect them all, let\nthis suffice. Take that Church (nearest at hand, and which is the only\nApostolic Church of the West), the great and glorious Church at Rome,\nwhich was there founded by the two apostles Peter and Paul. In her have\nbeen preserved the traditions \u003ci\u003eof all the Churches\u003c/i\u003e, because\neverybody is forced to go to the seat of empire: and therefore, by these\nrepresentatives of the whole Catholic Church, the apostolic traditions\nhave been all collected in Rome:, because\neverybody is forced to go to the seat of empire: and therefore, by these\nrepresentatives of the whole Catholic Church, the apostolic traditions\nhave been all collected in Rome:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3797\"\u003e3797\u003c/sup\u003e and you have a synoptical\nview of all Churches in what is there preserved.” Had the views of\nthe modern Papacy ever entered the head of Irenæus, what an absurdity\nwould be this whole argument. He would have said, “It is no matter\nwhat may be gathered elsewhere; for the Bishop of Rome is the infallible\noracle of all Catholic truth, and you will always find it by his\nmouth.” It should be noted that Orthodoxy was indeed preserved\nthere, just so long as Rome permitted other Churches to contribute their\ntestimony on the principle of Irenæus, and thus to make her the\ndepository of all Catholic tradition, as witnessed “by \u003ci\u003eall,\neverywhere\u003c/i\u003e, and from the beginning.” But all this is turned\nupside down by modern Romanism. No other Church is to be heard or\nconsidered; but Rome takes all into her own power, and may dictate to all\nChurches what they are to believe, however novel, or contrary to the\ntorrent of antiquity in the teachings of their own founders and great\ndoctors in all past time., and from the beginning.” But all this is turned\nupside down by modern Romanism.

And again, the Lord Himself exhibits Abraham as having said\nto the rich man, with reference to all those who were still alive:\n“If they do not obey Moses and the prophets, neither, if any one\nwere to rise from the dead and go to them, will they believe\nhim.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3815\"\u003e3815\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.iii-p12\"\u003e4. Now, He has not merely related to us a story\nrespecting a poor man and a rich one; but He has taught us, in the first\nplace, that no one should lead a luxurious life, nor, living in worldly\npleasures and perpetual feastings, should be the slave of his lusts, and\nforget God. “For there was,” He says, “a rich man, who\nwas clothed in purple and fine linen, and delighted himself with splendid\nfeasts.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3816\"\u003e3816\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.iii-p14\"\u003e5. Of such persons, too, the Spirit has spoken by\nEsaias: “They drink wine with [the accompaniment of] harps, and\ntablets, and psalteries, and flutes; but they regard not the works of\nGod, neither do they consider the work of His hands.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3817\"\u003e3817\u003c/sup\u003e Lest, therefore, we should incur the same\npunishment as these men, the Lord reveals [to us] their end; showing at\nthe same time, that if they obeyed Moses and the prophets, they would\nbelieve in Him whom these had preached, the Son of God, who rose from the\ndead, and bestows life upon us; and He shows that all are from one\nessence, that is, Abraham, and Moses, and the prophets, and also the Lord\nHimself, who rose from the dead, in whom many believe who are of the\ncircumcision, who do also hear Moses and the prophets announcing the\ncoming of the Son of God. But those who scoff [at the truth] assert that\nthese men were from another essence, and they do not know the\nfirst-begotten from the dead; understanding Christ as a distinct being,\nwho continued as if He were impassible, and Jesus, who suffered, as being\naltogether separate [from Him].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.iii-p16\"\u003e6. For they do not receive from the Father the\nknowledge of the Son; neither do they learn who the Father is from the\nSon, who teaches clearly and without parables Him who truly is God. He\nsays: “Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God’s\nthrone; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; neither by Jerusalem,\nfor it is the city of the great King.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3818\"\u003e3818\u003c/sup\u003e For these words are evidently spoken with reference to the\nCreator, as also Esaias says: “Heaven is my throne, the earth is my\nfootstool.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3819\"\u003e3819\u003c/sup\u003e And besides this Being\nthere is no other God; otherwise He would not be termed by the Lord\neither “God” or “the great King;” for a Being who\ncan be so described admits neither of any other being compared with nor\nset above Him. For he who has any superior over him, and is under the\npower of another, this being never can be called either “God”\nor “the great King.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.iii-p19\"\u003e7. But neither will these men be able to maintain that\nsuch words were uttered in an ironical manner, since it is proved to them\nby the words themselves that they were in earnest. For He who uttered\nthem was Truth, and did truly vindicate His own house, by driving out of\nit the changers of money, who were buying and selling, saying unto them:\n“It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but\nye have made it a den of thieves.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3820\"\u003e3820\u003c/sup\u003e And what\nreason had He for thus doing and saying, and vindicating His house, if He\ndid preach another God? But [He did so], that He might point out the\ntransgressors of His Father’s law; for neither did He bring any\naccusation against the house, nor did He blame the law, which He had come\nto fulfil; but He reproved those who were putting His house to an\nimproper use, and those who were transgressing the law. And therefore the\nscribes and Pharisees, too, who from the times of the law had begun to\ndespise God, did not receive His Word, that is, they did not believe on\nChrist. Of these Esaias says: “Thy princes are rebellious,\ncompanions of thieves, loving gifts, following after rewards, not judging\nthe fatherless, and negligent of the cause of the widows.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3821\"\u003e3821\u003c/sup\u003e And Jeremiah, in like manner:\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_465.html\" id=\"ix.vi.iii-Page_465\" n=\"465\" /\u003e\n\n“They,” he says, “who rule my people did not\nknow me; they are senseless and imprudent children; they are wise to do\nevil, but to do well they have no knowledge.”\n\n“They,” he says, “who rule my people did not\nknow me; they are senseless and imprudent children; they are wise to do\nevil, but to do well they have no knowledge.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3822\"\u003e3822\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.iii-p23\"\u003e8.

In his book against Marcion,\nJustin\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3859\"\u003e3859\u003c/sup\u003e\ndoes well say: “I would not have believed the Lord Himself, if He\nhad announced any other than He who is our framer, maker, and nourisher.\nBut because the only-begotten Son came to us from the one God, who both\nmade this world and formed us, and contains and administers all things,\nsumming up His own handiwork in Himself, my faith towards Him is\nstedfast, and my love to the Father immoveable, God bestowing both upon\nus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.vii-p6\"\u003e3. For no one can know the Father,\nunless through the Word of God, that is, unless by the Son revealing\n[Him]; neither can he have knowledge of the Son, unless through the good\npleasure of the Father. But the Son performs the good pleasure of the\nFather; for the Father sends, and the Son is sent, and comes. And His\nWord knows that His Father is, as far as regards us, invisible and\ninfinite; and since He cannot be declared [by any one else], He does\nHimself declare Him to us; and, on the other hand, it is the Father alone\nwho knows His own Word. And both these truths has our Lord declared.\nWherefore the Son reveals the knowledge of the Father through His own\nmanifestation. For the manifestation of the Son is the knowledge of the\nFather; for all things are manifested through the Word. In order,\ntherefore, that we might know that the Son who came is He who imparts to\nthose believing on Him a knowledge of the Father, He said to His\ndisciples:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3860\"\u003e3860\u003c/sup\u003e “No man knoweth the Son but the Father, nor\nthe Father but the Son, and those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal\nHim;” thus setting Himself forth and the Father as He [really] is,\nthat we may not receive any other Father, except Him who is revealed by\nthe Son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.vii-p8\"\u003e4. But this [Father] is the Maker of heaven and earth,\nas is shown from His words; and not he, the false father, who has been\ninvented by Marcion, or by Valentinus, or by Basilides, or by\nCarpocrates, or by Simon, or by the rest of the “Gnostics,”\nfalsely so called. For none of these was the Son of God; but Christ Jesus\nour Lord [was], against whom they set their teaching in opposition, and\nhave the daring to preach an unknown God. But they ought to hear [this]\nagainst themselves: How is it that He is unknown, who is known by them?\nfor, whatever is known even by a few, is not unknown. But the Lord did\nnot say that both the Father and the Son could not be known at all (\u003ci\u003ein\ntotum\u003c/i\u003e), for in that case His advent would have been superfluous. For\nwhy did He come hither? Was it that He should say to us, “Never\nmind seeking after God; for He is unknown, and ye shall not find\nHim;” as also the disciples of Valentinus falsely declare that\nChrist said to their Æons? But this is indeed vain. For the Lord taught\nus that no man is capable of knowing God, unless he be taught of God;\nthat is, that God cannot be known without God: but that this is the\nexpress will of the Father, that God should be known. For they shall\nknow), for in that case His advent would have been superfluous. For\nwhy did He come hither?

And for this purpose did the Father reveal the Son,\nthat through His instrumentality He might be manifested to all, and might\nreceive those righteous ones who believe in Him into incorruption and\neverlasting enjoyment (now, to believe in Him is to do His will); but He\nshall righteously shut out into the darkness which they have chosen for\nthemselves, those who do not believe, and who do consequently avoid His\nlight. The Father therefore has revealed Himself to all, by making His\nWord visible to all; and, conversely, the Word has declared to all the\nFather and the Son, since He has become visible to all. And therefore the\nrighteous judgment of God [shall fall] upon all who, like\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_469.html\" id=\"ix.vi.vii-Page_469\" n=\"469\" /\u003e\n\nothers, have seen, but have not, like others, believed.\n\nothers, have seen, but have not, like others, believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.vii-p11\"\u003e6. For by means of the creation itself, the Word\nreveals God the Creator; and by means of the world [does He declare] the\nLord the Maker of the world; and by means of the formation [of man] the\nArtificer who formed him; and by the Son that Father who begat the Son:\nand these things do indeed address all men in the same manner, but all do\nnot in the same way believe them. But by the law and the prophets did the\nWord preach both Himself and the Father alike [to all]; and all the\npeople heard Him alike, but all did not alike believe. And through the\nWord Himself who had been made visible and palpable, was the Father shown\nforth, although all did not equally believe in Him; but all saw the\nFather in the Son: for the Father is the invisible of the Son, but the\nSon the visible of the Father. And for this reason all spake with Christ\nwhen He was present [upon earth], and they named Him God. Yea, even the\ndemons exclaimed, on beholding the Son: “We know Thee who Thou art,\nthe Holy One of God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3862\"\u003e3862\u003c/sup\u003e And the\ndevil looking at Him, and tempting Him, said: “If Thou art the Son\nof God;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3863\"\u003e3863\u003c/sup\u003e—all thus indeed seeing and speaking of the Son and the\nFather, but all not believing [in them].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.vii-p14\"\u003e7. For it was fitting that the truth should receive\ntestimony from all, and should become [a means of] judgment for the\nsalvation indeed of those who believe, but for the condemnation of those\nwho believe not; that all should be fairly judged, and that the faith in\nthe Father and Son should be approved by all, that is, that it should be\nestablished by all [as the one means of salvation], receiving testimony\nfrom all, both from those belonging to it, since they are its friends,\nand by those having no connection with it, though they are its enemies.\nFor that evidence is true, and cannot be gainsaid, which elicits even\nfrom its adversaries striking\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3864\"\u003e3864\u003c/sup\u003e testimonies in its behalf;\nthey being convinced with respect to the matter in hand by their own\nplain contemplation of it, and bearing testimony to it, as well as\ndeclaring it.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3865\"\u003e3865\u003c/sup\u003e But after a while they\nbreak forth into enmity, and become accusers [of what they had approved],\nand are desirous that their own testimony should not be [regarded as]\ntrue. He, therefore, who was known, was not a different being from Him\nwho declared “No man knoweth the Father,” but one and the\nsame, the Father making all things subject to Him; while He received\ntestimony from all that He was very man, and that He was very God, from\nthe Father, from the Spirit, from angels, from the creation itself, from\nmen, from apostate spirits and demons, from the enemy, and last of all,\nfrom death itself. But the Son, administering all things for the Father,\nworks from the beginning even to the end, and without Him no man can\nattain the knowledge of God. For the Son is the knowledge of the Father;\nbut the knowledge of the Son is in the Father, and has been revealed\nthrough the Son; and this was the reason why the Lord declared: “No\nman knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, save the Son, and\nthose to whomsoever the Son shall reveal [Him].”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3866\"\u003e3866\u003c/sup\u003e For “shall reveal” was said not with\nreference to the future alone, as if then [only] the Word had begun to\nmanifest the Father when He was born of Mary, but it applies\nindifferently throughout all time. For the Son, being present with His\nown handiwork from the beginning, reveals the Father to all; to whom He\nwills, and when He wills, and as the Father wills. Wherefore, then, in\nall things, and through all things, there is one God, the Father, and one\nWord, and one Son, and one Spirit, and one salvation to all who believe\nin Him.\u003c/p\u003e",

For the law did not prohibit men from being healed upon the\nSabbaths; [on the contrary,] it even circumcised them upon that day, and\ngave command that the offices should be performed by the priests for the\npeople; yea, it did not disallow the healing even of dumb animals.

And therefore the Lord reproved\nthose who unjustly blamed Him for having healed upon the Sabbath-days.\nFor He did not make void, but fulfilled the law, by performing the\noffices of the high priest, propitiating God for men, and cleansing the\nlepers, healing the sick, and Himself suffering death, that exiled man\nmight go forth from condemnation, and might return without fear to his\nown inheritance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.ix-p9\"\u003e3. And\nagain, the law did not forbid those who were hungry on the Sabbath-days\nto take food lying ready at hand: it did, however, forbid them to reap\nand to gather into the barn. And therefore did the Lord say to those who\nwere blaming His disciples because they plucked and ate the ears of corn,\nrubbing them in their hands, “Have ye not read this, what David\ndid, when himself was an hungered; how he went into the house of God, and\nate the shew-bread, and gave to those who were with him; which it is not\nlawful to eat, but for the priests alone?”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3887\"\u003e3887\u003c/sup\u003e justifying His disciples by the words of the law, and pointing\nout that it was lawful for the priests to act freely.

But I say unto you, That every one\nwho hath looked upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery\nwith her already in his heart.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3949\"\u003e3949\u003c/sup\u003e And\nagain: “It has been said, Thou shalt not kill.

For all these do not contain or imply an opposition to\nand an overturning of the [precepts] of the past, as Marcion’s\nfollowers do strenuously maintain; but [they exhibit] a fulfilling and an\nextension of them, as He does Himself declare: “Unless your\nrighteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall\nnot enter into the kingdom of heaven.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3952\"\u003e3952\u003c/sup\u003e For what meant the excess referred to? In the first place, [we\nmust] believe not only in the Father, but also in His Son now revealed;\nfor He it is who leads man into fellowship and unity with God. In the\nnext place, [we must] not only say, but we must do; for they said, but\ndid not. And [we must] not only abstain from evil deeds, but even from\nthe desires after them. Now He did not teach us these things as being\nopposed to the law, but as fulfilling the law, and implanting in us the\nvaried righteousness of the law. That would have been contrary to the\nlaw, if He had commanded His disciples to do anything which the law had\nprohibited. But this which He did command—namely, not only to\nabstain from things forbidden by the law, but even from longing after\nthem—is not contrary to [the law], as I have remarked, neither is\nit the utterance of one destroying the law, but of one fulfilling,\nextending, and affording greater scope to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xiv-p7\"\u003e2. For the law, since it was laid down for those in\nbondage, used to instruct the soul by means of those corporeal objects\nwhich were of an external nature, drawing it, as by a bond, to obey its\ncommandments, that man might learn to serve God. But the Word set free\nthe soul, and taught that through it the body should be willingly\npurified. Which having been accomplished, it followed as of course, that\nthe bonds of slavery should be removed, to which man had now become\naccustomed, and that he should follow God without fetters: moreover, that\nthe laws of liberty should be extended, and subjection to the king\nincreased, so that no one who is converted should appear unworthy to Him\nwho set him free, but that the piety and obedience due to the Master of\nthe household should be equally rendered both by servants and children;\nwhile the children possess greater confidence [than the servants],\ninasmuch as the working of liberty is greater and more glorious than that\nobedience which is rendered in [a state of] slavery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xiv-p8\"\u003e3. And for this reason did the Lord, instead of that\n[commandment], “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” forbid even\nconcupiscence; and instead of that which runs thus, “Thou shalt not\nkill,” He prohibited anger; and instead of the law enjoining the\ngiving of tithes, [He told us] to share\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3953\"\u003e3953\u003c/sup\u003e all our\npossessions with the poor; and not to love our neighbours only, but even\nour enemies; and not merely to be liberal givers and bestowers, but even\nthat we should present a gratuitous gift to those who take away our\ngoods. For “to him that taketh away thy coat,” He says,\n“give to him thy cloak also; and from him that taketh away thy\ngoods, ask them not again; and as ye would that men should do unto you,\ndo ye unto them:”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3954\"\u003e3954\u003c/sup\u003e so that we may not\ngrieve as those who are unwilling to be defrauded, but may rejoice as\nthose who have given willingly, and as rather conferring a favour upon\nour neighbours than yielding to necessity. “And if any one,”\nHe says, “shall compel thee [to go] a mile, go with him\ntwain;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3955\"\u003e3955\u003c/sup\u003e so that thou mayest not\nfollow him as a slave, but may as a free man go before him, showing\nthyself in all things kindly disposed and useful to thy neighbour, not\nregarding their evil intentions, but performing thy kind offices,\nassimilating thyself to the Father, “who maketh His sun to rise\nupon the evil and the good, and sendeth\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_478.html\" id=\"ix.vi.xiv-Page_478\" n=\"478\" /\u003e\n\nrain upon the just\nand unjust.”\n\nrain upon the just\nand unjust.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3956\"\u003e3956\u003c/sup\u003e Now all these [precepts],\nas I have already observed, were not [the injunctions] of one doing away\nwith the law, but of one fulfilling, extending, and widening it among us;\njust as if one should say, that the more extensive operation of liberty\nimplies that a more complete subjection and affection towards our\nLiberator had been implanted within us. For He did not set us free for\nthis purpose, that we should depart from Him (no one, indeed, while\nplaced out of reach of the Lord’s benefits, has power to procure\nfor himself the means of salvation), but that the more we receive His\ngrace, the more we should love Him. Now the more we have loved Him, the\nmore glory shall we receive from Him, when we are continually in the\npresence of the Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xiv-p13\"\u003e4. Inasmuch, then, as all natural precepts are common\nto us and to them (the Jews), they had in them indeed the beginning and\norigin; but in us they have received growth and completion. For to yield\nassent to God, and to follow His Word, and to love Him above all, and\none’s neighbour as one’s self (now man is neighbour to man),\nand to abstain from every evil deed, and all other things of a like\nnature which are common to both [covenants], do reveal one and the same\nGod. But this is our Lord, the Word of God, who in the first instance\ncertainly drew slaves to God, but afterwards He set those free who were\nsubject to Him, as He does Himself declare to His disciples: “I\nwill not now call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord\ndoeth; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard\nfrom My Father I have made known.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3957\"\u003e3957\u003c/sup\u003e For in\nthat which He says, “I will not now call you servants,” He\nindicates in the most marked manner that it was Himself who did\noriginally appoint for men that bondage with respect to God through the\nlaw, and then afterwards conferred upon them freedom. And in that He\nsays, “For the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth,” He\npoints out, by means of His own advent, the ignorance of a people in a\nservile condition. But when He terms His disciples “the friends of\nGod,” He plainly declares Himself to be the Word of God, whom\nAbraham also followed voluntarily and under no compulsion (\u003ci\u003esine\nvinculis\u003c/i\u003e), because of the noble nature of his faith, and so became\n“the friend of God.”), because of the noble nature of his faith, and so became\n“the friend of God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3958\"\u003e3958\u003c/sup\u003e But the\nWord of God did not accept of the friendship of Abraham, as though He\nstood in need of it, for He was perfect from the beginning (“Before\nAbraham was,” He says, “I am”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3959\"\u003e3959\u003c/sup\u003e), but that He in His goodness might bestow eternal life upon\nAbraham himself, inasmuch as the friendship of God imparts immortality to\nthose who embrace it.\u003c/p\u003e",

In\nthe beginning, therefore, did God form Adam, not as if He stood in need\nof man, but that He might have [some one] upon whom to confer His\nbenefits. For not alone antecedently to Adam, but also before all\ncreation, the Word glorified His Father, remaining in Him; and was\nHimself glorified by the Father, as He did Himself declare,\n“Father, glorify Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee\nbefore the world was.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3960\"\u003e3960\u003c/sup\u003e Nor did\nHe stand in need of our service when He ordered us to follow Him; but He\nthus bestowed salvation upon ourselves. For to follow the Saviour is to\nbe a partaker of salvation, and to follow light is to receive light. But\nthose who are in light do not themselves illumine the light, but are\nillumined and revealed by it: they do certainly contribute nothing to it,\nbut, receiving the benefit, they are illumined by the light. Thus, also,\nservice [rendered] to God does indeed profit God nothing, nor has God\nneed of human obedience; but He grants to those who follow and serve Him\nlife and incorruption and eternal glory, bestowing benefit upon those who\nserve [Him], because they do serve Him, and on His followers, because\nthey do follow Him; but does not receive any benefit from them: for He is\nrich, perfect, and in need of nothing. But for this reason does God\ndemand service from men, in order that, since He is good and merciful, He\nmay benefit those who continue in His service. For, as much as God is in\nwant of nothing, so much does man stand in need of fellowship with God.\nFor this is the glory of man, to continue and remain permanently in\nGod’s service. Wherefore also did the Lord say to His disciples,\n“Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3961\"\u003e3961\u003c/sup\u003e indicating that they did not glorify Him when\nthey followed Him; but that, in following the Son of God, they were\nglorified by Him.

Thus it was, too, that God formed man at the first,\nbecause of His munificence; but chose the patriarchs for the sake of\ntheir salvation; and prepared a people beforehand, teaching the\nheadstrong to follow God; and raised up prophets upon earth, accustoming\nman to bear His Spirit [within him], and to hold communion with God: He\nHimself, indeed, having need of nothing, but granting communion with\nHimself to those who stood in need of it, and sketching out, like an\narchitect, the plan of salvation to those that pleased Him. And He did\nHimself furnish guidance to those who beheld Him not in Egypt, while to\nthose who became unruly in the desert He promulgated a law very suitable\n[to their condition]. Then, on the people who entered into the good land\nHe bestowed a noble inheritance; and He killed the fatted calf for those\nconverted to the Father, and presented them with the finest robe.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3965\"\u003e3965\u003c/sup\u003e Thus, in a variety of ways, He adjusted the\nhuman race to an agreement with salvation.

Thus, too, He imposed upon the [Jewish] people the\nconstruction of the tabernacle, the building of the temple, the election\nof the Levites, sacrifices also, and oblations, legal monitions, and all\nthe other service of the law. He does Himself truly want none of these\nthings, for He is always full of all good, and had in Himself all the\nodour of kindness, and every perfume of sweet-smelling savours, even\nbefore Moses existed. Moreover, He instructed the people, who were prone\nto turn to idols, instructing them by repeated appeals to persevere and\nto serve God, calling them to the things of primary importance by means\nof those which were secondary; that is, to things that are real, by means\nof those that are typical; and by things temporal, to eternal; and by the\ncarnal to the spiritual; and by the earthly to the heavenly; as was also\nsaid to Moses, “Thou shalt make all things after the pattern of\nthose things which thou sawest in the mount.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3967\"\u003e3967\u003c/sup\u003e For during forty days He was learning to keep [in his memory] the\nwords of God, and the celestial patterns, and the spiritual images, and\nthe types of things to come; as also Paul says: “For they drank of\nthe rock which followed them: and the rock was Christ.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"3968\"\u003e3968\u003c/sup\u003e And again, having first mentioned what are\ncontained in the law, he goes on to say: “Now all these things\nhappened to them in a figure; but they were written for our admonition,\nupon whom the end of the ages is come.” For by means of types they\nlearned to fear God, and to continue devoted to His service.\u003c/p\u003e",

And because it is [the name] of His own Son, who\nwas made man by Him, He calls it His own. Just as a king, if he himself\npaints a likeness of his son, is right in calling this likeness his own,\nfor both these reasons, because it is [the likeness] of his son, and\nbecause it is his own production; so also does the Father confess the\nname of Jesus Christ, which is throughout all the world glorified in the\nChurch, to be His own, both because it is that of His Son, and because He\nwho thus describes it gave Him for the salvation of men. Since,\ntherefore, the name of the Son belongs to the Father, and since in the\nomnipotent God the Church makes offerings through Jesus Christ, He says\nwell on both these grounds, “And in every place incense is offered\nto My name, and a pure sacrifice.” Now John, in the Apocalypse,\ndeclares that the “incense” is “the prayers of the\nsaints.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4033\"\u003e4033\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Thus, therefore, was God revealed; for God the\nFather is shown forth through all these [operations], the Spirit indeed\nworking, and the Son ministering, while the Father was approving, and\nman’s salvation being accomplished. As He also declares through\nHosea the prophet: “I,” He says, “have multiplied\nvisions, and have used similitudes by the ministry (\u003ci\u003ein manibus\u003c/i\u003e) of\nthe prophets.”) of\nthe prophets.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4082\"\u003e4082\u003c/sup\u003e But the apostle expounded\nthis very passage, when he said, “Now there are diversities of\ngifts, but the same Spirit; and there are differences of ministrations,\nbut the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the\nsame God which worketh all in all.

For where there is a regular succession, there is\nalso fixedness; and where fixedness, there suitability to the period; and\nwhere suitability, there also utility. And for this reason did the Word\nbecome the dispenser of the paternal grace for the benefit of men, for\nwhom He made such great dispensations, revealing God indeed to men, but\npresenting man to God, and preserving at the same time the invisibility\nof the Father, lest man should at any time become a despiser of God, and\nthat he should\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_490.html\" id=\"ix.vi.xxi-Page_490\" n=\"490\" /\u003e\n\nalways possess something towards which he\nmight advance; but, on the other hand, revealing God to men through many\ndispensations, lest man, falling away from God altogether, should cease\nto exist.

For the prophets used not\nto prophesy in word alone, but in visions also, and in their mode of\nlife, and in the actions which they performed, according to the\nsuggestions of the Spirit.

For as He who was born Christ according to the flesh, had\nindeed to be sought after by the people in order to be slain, but was to\nbe set free in Egypt, that is, among the Gentiles, to sanctify those who\nwere there in a state of infancy, from whom also He perfected His Church\nin that place (for Egypt was Gentile from the beginning, as was Ethiopia\nalso); for this reason, by means of the marriage of Moses, was shown\nforth the marriage of the Word;\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4111\"\u003e4111\u003c/sup\u003e and by means of the Ethiopian bride, the Church taken from among\nthe Gentiles was made manifest; and those who do detract from, accuse,\nand deride it, shall not be pure.

It is\nclear that they are the patriarchs and prophets, who even prefigured our\nfaith, and disseminated through the earth the advent of the Son of God,\nwho and what He should be: so that posterity, possessing the fear of God,\nmight easily accept the advent of Christ, having been instructed by the\nprophets. And for this reason it was, that when Joseph became aware that\nMary was with child, and was minded to put her away privily, the angel\nsaid to him in sleep: “Fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for\nthat which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. For she shall bring\nforth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His\npeople from their sins.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4132\"\u003e4132\u003c/sup\u003e And\nexhorting him [to this], he added: “Now all this has been done,\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet,\nsaying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a\nson, and His name shall be called Emmanuel;” thus influencing him\nby the words of the prophet, and warding off blame from Mary, pointing\nout that it was she who was the virgin mentioned by Isaiah beforehand,\nwho should give birth to Emmanuel. Wherefore, when Joseph was convinced\nbeyond all doubt, he both did take Mary, and joyfully yielded obedience\nin regard to all the rest of the education of Christ, undertaking a\njourney into Egypt and back again, and then a removal to Nazareth. [For\nthis reason,] those who knew not the Scriptures nor the promise of God,\nnor the dispensation of Christ, at last called him the father of the\nchild. For this reason, too, did the Lord Himself read at Capernaum the\nprophecies of Isaiah:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4133\"\u003e4133\u003c/sup\u003e “The Spirit of the\nLord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me; to preach the Gospel to the\npoor hath He sent Me, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance\nto the captives, and sight to the blind.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4134\"\u003e4134\u003c/sup\u003e At the same time, showing that it was He Himself who had been\nforetold by Esaias the prophet, He said to them: “This day is this\nScripture fulfilled in your ears.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xxiv-p6\"\u003e2.

For as, in the New Testament, that faith of men [to\nbe placed] in God has been increased, receiving in addition [to what was\nalready revealed] the Son of God, that man too might be a partaker of\nGod; so is also our walk in life required to be more circumspect, when we\nare directed not merely to abstain from evil actions, but even from evil\nthoughts, and from idle words, and empty talk, and scurrilous\nlanguage:\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4201\"\u003e4201\u003c/sup\u003e thus\nalso the punishment of those who do not believe the Word of God, and\ndespise His advent, and are turned away backwards, is increased; being\nnot merely temporal, but rendered also eternal.

For the self-same heretics already mentioned by us\nhave fallen away from themselves, by accusing the Lord, in whom they say\nthat they believe. For those points to which they call attention with\nregard to the God who then awarded temporal punishments to the\nunbelieving, and smote the Egyptians, while He saved those that were\nobedient; these same [facts, I say,] shall nevertheless repeat themselves\nin the Lord, who judges for eternity those whom He doth judge, and lets\ngo free for eternity those whom He does let go free: and He shall [thus]\nbe discovered, according to the language used by these men, as having\nbeen the cause of their most heinous sin to those who laid hands upon\nHim, and pierced Him. For if He had not so come, it follows that these\nmen could not have become the slayers of their Lord; and if He had not\nsent prophets to them, they certainly could not have killed them, nor the\napostles either. To those, therefore, who assail us, and say, If the\nEgyptians had not been afflicted with plagues, and, when pursuing after\nIsrael, been choked in the sea, God could not have saved His people, this\nanswer may be given;—Unless, then, the Jews had become the\nslayers of the Lord (which did, indeed, take eternal life away from\nthem), and, by killing the apostles and persecuting the Church, had\nfallen into an abyss of wrath, we could not have been saved. For as they\nwere saved by means of the blindness of the Egyptians, so are we, too, by\nthat of the Jews; if, indeed, the death of the Lord is the condemnation\nof those who fastened Him to the cross, and who did not believe His\nadvent, but the salvation of those who believe in Him. For the apostle\ndoes also say in the Second [Epistle] to the Corinthians: “For we\nare unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them which are saved, and in\nthem which perish: to the one indeed the savour of death unto death,\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_502.html\" id=\"ix.vi.xxix-Page_502\" n=\"502\" /\u003e\n\nbut to the other the savour of life unto life.”\n\nbut to the other the savour of life unto life.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4204\"\u003e4204\u003c/sup\u003e To whom, then, is there the savour of death\nunto death, unless to those who believe not neither are subject to the\nWord of God?

For, because He knew that we would make a good\nuse of our substance which we should possess by receiving it from\nanother, He says, “He that hath two coats, let him impart to him\nthat hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4221\"\u003e4221\u003c/sup\u003e And, “For I was an hungered, and ye gave\nMe meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was naked and ye clothed\nMe.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4222\"\u003e4222\u003c/sup\u003e And, “When thou\ndoest thine alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand\ndoeth.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4223\"\u003e4223\u003c/sup\u003e And we are proved to be\nrighteous by whatsoever else we do well, redeeming, as it were, our\nproperty from strange hands. But thus do I say, “from strange\nhands,” not as if the world were not God’s possession, but\nthat we have gifts of this sort, and receive them from others, in the\nsame way as these men had them from the Egyptians who knew not God; and\nby means of these same do we erect in ourselves the tabernacle of God:\nfor God dwells in those who act uprightly, as the Lord says: “Make\nto yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that they, when\nye shall be put to flight,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4224\"\u003e4224\u003c/sup\u003e may receive you into eternal tabernacles.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4225\"\u003e4225\u003c/sup\u003e For whatsoever we acquired from unrighteousness when we were\nheathen, we are proved righteous, when we have become believers, by\napplying it to the Lord’s advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xxxi-p16\"\u003e4.

For not one of those things which have been set down in\nScripture without being condemned is without significance.” An\nexample is found in the case of Lot, who led forth his daughters from\nSodom, and these then conceived by their own father; and who left behind\nhim within the confines [of the land] his wife, [who remains] a pillar of\nsalt unto this day. For Lot, not acting under the impulse of his own\nwill, nor at the prompting of carnal concupiscence, nor having any\nknowledge or thought of anything of the kind, did [in fact] work out a\ntype [of future events]. As says the Scripture: “And that night the\nelder went in\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_505.html\" id=\"ix.vi.xxxii-Page_505\" n=\"505\" /\u003e\n\nand lay with her father; and Lot knew not when\nshe lay down, nor when she arose.”\n\nand lay with her father; and Lot knew not when\nshe lay down, nor when she arose.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4230\"\u003e4230\u003c/sup\u003e And the\nsame thing took place in the case of the younger: “And he knew\nnot,” it is said, “when she slept with him, nor when she\narose.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4231\"\u003e4231\u003c/sup\u003e Since, therefore, Lot knew\nnot [what he did], nor was a slave to lust [in his actions], the\narrangement [designed by God] was carried out, by which the two daughters\n(that is, the two churches\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4232\"\u003e4232\u003c/sup\u003e), who gave birth to children begotten of\none and the same father, were pointed out, apart from [the influence of]\nthe lust of the flesh. For there was no other person, [as they supposed],\nwho could impart to them quickening seed, and the means of their giving\nbirth to children, as it is written: “And the elder said unto the\nyounger, And there is not a man on the earth to enter in unto us after\nthe manner of all the earth: come, let us make our father drunk with\nwine, and let us lie with him, and raise up seed from our\nfather.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4233\"\u003e4233\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xxxii-p7\"\u003e2. Thus, after their simplicity and innocence, did\nthese daughters [of Lot] so speak, imagining that all mankind had\nperished, even as the Sodomites had done, and that the anger of God had\ncome down upon the whole earth. Wherefore also they are to be held\nexcusable, since they supposed that they only, along with their father,\nwere left for the preservation of the human race; and for this reason it\nwas that they deceived their father. Moreover, by the words they used\nthis fact was pointed out—that there is no other one who can\nconfer upon the elder and younger church the [power of] giving birth to\nchildren, besides our Father. Now the father of the human race is the\nWord of God, as Moses points out when he says, “Is not He thy\nfather who hath obtained thee [by generation], and formed thee, and\ncreated thee?”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4234\"\u003e4234\u003c/sup\u003e At what time, then, did He\npour out upon the human race the life-giving seed—that is, the\nSpirit of the remission of sins, through means of whom we are quickened?\nWas it not then, when He was eating with men, and drinking wine upon the\nearth?

But if a\nthought of this kind should then suggest itself to you, to say, What then\ndid the Lord bring to us by His advent?—know ye that He brought\nall [possible] novelty, by bringing Himself who had been announced. For\nthis very thing was proclaimed beforehand, that a novelty should come to\nrenew and quicken mankind. For the advent of the King is previously\nannounced by those servants who are sent [before Him], in order to the\npreparation and equipment of those men who are to entertain their Lord.\nBut when the King has actually come, and those who are His subjects have\nbeen filled with that joy which was proclaimed beforehand, and have\nattained to that liberty which He bestows, and share in the sight of Him,\nand have listened to His words, and have enjoyed the gifts which He\nconfers, the question will not then be asked by any that are possessed of\nsense what new thing the King has brought beyond [that proclaimed by]\nthose who announced His coming.

But if, when the Saviour came to this earth, He sent\nHis apostles into the world to proclaim with accuracy His advent, and to\nteach the Father’s will, having nothing in common with the doctrine\nof the Gentiles or of the Jews, much more, while yet existing in the\nPleroma, would He have appointed His own heralds to proclaim His future\nadvent into this world, and having nothing in common with those\nprophecies originating from the Demiurge. But if, when within the\nPleroma, He availed Himself of those prophets who were under the law, and\ndeclared His own matters through their instrumentality; much more would\nHe, upon His arrival hither, have made use of these same teachers, and\nhave preached the Gospel to us by their means. Therefore let them not any\nlonger assert that Peter and Paul and the other apostles proclaimed the\ntruth, but that it was the scribes and Pharisees, and the others, through\nwhom the law was propounded. But if, at His advent, He sent forth His own\napostles in the spirit of truth, and not in that of error, He did the\nvery same also in the case of the prophets; for the Word of God was\nalways the self-same: and if the Spirit from the Pleroma was, according\nto these men’s system, the Spirit of light, the Spirit of truth,\nthe Spirit of perfection, and the Spirit of knowledge, while that from\nthe Demiurge was the spirit of ignorance, degeneracy, and error, and the\noffspring of obscurity; how can it be, that in one and the same being\nthere exists perfection and defect, knowledge and ignorance, error and\ntruth, light and darkness? But if it was impossible that such should\nhappen in the case of the prophets, for they preached the word of the\nLord from one God, and proclaimed the advent of His Son, much more would\nthe Lord Himself never have uttered words, on one occasion from above,\nbut on another from degeneracy below, thus becoming the teacher at once\nof knowledge and of ignorance; nor would He have ever glorified as Father\nat one time the Founder of the world, and at another Him who is above\nthis one, as He does Himself declare: “No man putteth a piece of a\nnew garment upon an old one, nor do they put new wine into old\nbottles.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4352\"\u003e4352\u003c/sup\u003e Let these men,\ntherefore, either have nothing whatever to do with the prophets, as with\nthose that are ancients, and allege no longer that these men, being sent\nbeforehand by the Demiurge, spake certain things under that new influence\nwhich pertains to the Pleroma; or, on the other hand, let them be\nconvinced by our Lord, when He declares that new wine cannot be put into\nold bottles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xxxvi-p4\"\u003e3. But from what source could the offspring of their\nmother derive his knowledge of the mysteries within the Pleroma, and\npower to discourse regarding them?

And the husbandmen took his\nservants: they cut one to pieces, stoned another, and killed another.\nAgain he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them\nlikewise. But last of all he sent unto them his only son, saying,\nPerchance they will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the\nson, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him,\nand we shall possess his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him\nout of the vineyard, and slew him. When, therefore, the lord of the\nvineyard shall come, what will he do unto these husbandmen?

In other words, He who at first\nused that law which entails bondage, is also He who did in after times\n[call His people] by means of adoption.

And thus did He send prophets prior\nto the transmigration to Babylon, and after that event others again in\ngreater number than the former, to seek the fruits, saying thus to them\n(the Jews): “Thus saith the Lord, Cleanse your ways and your\ndoings, execute just judgment, and look each one with pity and compassion\non his brother: oppress not the widow nor the orphan, the proselyte nor\nthe poor, and let none of you treasure up evil against his brother in\nyour hearts, and love not false swearing.

For the illustrious Church is [now] everywhere, and\neverywhere is the winepress digged: because those who do receive the\nSpirit are everywhere. For inasmuch as the former have rejected the Son\nof God, and cast Him out of the vineyard when they slew Him, God has\njustly rejected them, and given to the Gentiles outside the vineyard the\nfruits of its cultivation.

But I so run, not as\nuncertainty; I fight, not as one beating the air; but I make my body\nlivid, and bring it into subjection, lest by any means, when preaching to\nothers, I may myself be rendered a castaway.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4414\"\u003e4414\u003c/sup\u003e This able wrestler, therefore,\nexhorts us to the struggle for immortality, that we may be crowned, and\nmay deem the crown precious, namely, that which is acquired by our\nstruggle, but which does not encircle us of its own accord (\u003ci\u003esed non\nultro coalitam\u003c/i\u003e).

Could not God have exhibited man as perfect from\nbeginning?” let him know that, inasmuch as God is indeed always the\nsame and unbegotten as respects Himself, all things are possible to Him.\nBut created things must be inferior to Him who created them, from the\nvery fact of their later origin; for it was not possible for things\nrecently created to have been uncreated. But inasmuch as they are not\nuncreated, for this very reason do they come short of the perfect.\nBecause, as these things are of later date, so are they infantile; so are\nthey unaccustomed to, and unexercised in, perfect discipline. For as it\ncertainly is in the power of a mother to give strong food to her infant,\n[but she does not do so], as the child is not yet able to receive more\nsubstantial nourishment; so also it was possible for God Himself to have\nmade man perfect from the first, but man could not receive this\n[perfection], being as yet an infant. And for this cause our Lord in\nthese last times, when He had summed up all things into Himself, came to\nus, not as He might have come, but as we were capable of beholding Him.\nHe might easily have come to us in His immortal glory, but in that case\nwe could never have endured the greatness of the glory; and therefore it\nwas that He, who was the perfect bread of the Father, offered Himself to\nus as milk, [because we were] as infants. He did this when He appeared as\na man, that we, being nourished, as it were, from the breast of His\nflesh, and having, by such a course of milk nourishment, become\naccustomed to eat and drink the Word of God, may be able also to contain\nin ourselves the Bread of immortality, which is the Spirit of the\nFather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vi.xxxix-p2\"\u003e2. And on this account does Paul declare to the\nCorinthians, “I have fed you with milk, not with meat, for hitherto\nye were not able to bear it.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4417\"\u003e4417\u003c/sup\u003e That is,\nye have indeed learned the advent of our Lord as a man; nevertheless,\nbecause of your infirmity, the Spirit of the Father has not as yet rested\nupon you. “For when envying and strife,” he says, “and\ndissensions are among you, are ye not carnal, and walk as\nmen?”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4418\"\u003e4418\u003c/sup\u003e That is, that the Spirit of the\nFather was not yet with them, on account of their imperfection and\nshortcomings of their walk in life. As, therefore, the apostle had the\npower to give them strong meat—for those upon whom the apostles\nlaid hands received the Holy Spirit, who is the food of life [eternal]\n—but they were not capable of receiving it, because they had the\nsentient faculties of the soul still feeble and undisciplined in the\npractice of things pertaining to God; so, in like manner, God had power\nat the beginning to grant perfection to man; but as the latter was only\nrecently created, he could not possibly have received it, or even if he\nhad received it, could he have contained it, or containing it, could he\nhave retained it. It was for this reason that the Son of God, although He\nwas perfect, passed through the state of infancy in common with the rest\nof mankind, partaking of it thus not for His own benefit, but for that of\nthe infantile stage of man’s existence, in order that man might be\nable to receive Him.

For from the very fact of these things having been created,\n[it follows] that they are not uncreated; but by their continuing in\nbeing throughout a long course of ages, they shall receive a faculty of\nthe Uncreated, through the gratuitous bestowal of eternal existence upon\nthem by God. And thus in all things God has the pre-eminence, who alone\nis uncreated, the first of all things, and the primary cause of the\nexistence of all, while all other things remain under God’s\nsubjection. But being in subjection to God is continuance in immortality,\nand immortality is the glory of the uncreated One. By this arrangement,\ntherefore, and these harmonies, and a sequence of this nature, man, a\ncreated and organized being, is rendered after the image and likeness of\nthe uncreated God,—the Father planning everything well and giving\nHis commands, the Son carrying these into execution\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_522.html\" id=\"ix.vi.xxxix-Page_522\" n=\"522\" /\u003e\n\nand\nperforming the work of creating, and the Spirit nourishing and increasing\n[what is made], but man making progress day by day, and ascending towards\nthe perfect, that is, approximating to the uncreated One.

But He made neither angels nor men so by nature. For we do\nnot find that the devil created anything whatsoever, since indeed he is\nhimself a creature of God, like the other angels.

Since, therefore, all things were made by God, and\nsince the devil has become the cause of apostasy to himself and others,\njustly does the Scripture always term those who remain in a state of\napostasy “sons of the devil” and “angels of the wicked\none” (\u003ci\u003emaligni\u003c/i\u003e). ). For [the word] “son,” as one\nbefore me has observed, has a twofold meaning: one [is a son] in the\norder of nature, because he was born a son; the other, in that he was\nmade so, is reputed a son, although there be a difference between being\nborn so and being made so. For the first is indeed born from the person\nreferred to; but the second is made so by him, whether as respects his\ncreation or by the teaching of his doctrine. For when any person has been\ntaught from the mouth of another, he is termed the son of him who\ninstructs him, and the latter [is called] his father. According to\nnature, then—that is, according to creation, so to speak—\nwe are all sons of God, because we have all been created by God.

For as, among men, those sons who disobey their\nfathers, being disinherited, are still their sons in the course of\nnature, but by law are disinherited, for they do not become the heirs of\ntheir natural parents; so in the same way is it with God,—those\nwho do not obey Him being disinherited by Him, have ceased to be His\nsons.

And upon this I besought the\nLord three times, that it might depart from me.

Also, that our bodies are raised not from their own substance,\nbut by the power of God, he says to the Corinthians, “Now the body\nis not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

Neither, on the other hand, can they\nsay that the spirit is the mortal body. What therefore is there left to\nwhich we may apply the term “mortal body,” unless it be the\nthing that was moulded, that is, the flesh, of which it is also said that\nGod will vivify it? For this it is which dies and is decomposed, but not\nthe soul or the spirit. For to die is to lose vital power, and to become\nhenceforth breathless, inanimate, and devoid of motion, and to melt away\ninto those [component parts] from which also it derived the commencement\nof [its] substance. But this event happens neither to the soul, for it is\nthe breath of life; nor to the spirit, for the spirit is simple and not\ncomposite, so that it cannot be decomposed, and is itself the life of\nthose who receive it. We must therefore conclude that it is in reference\nto the flesh that death is mentioned; which [flesh], after the\nsoul’s departure, becomes breathless and inanimate, and is\ndecomposed gradually into the earth from which it was taken. This, then,\nis what is mortal. And it is this of which he also says, “He shall\nalso quicken your mortal bodies.” And therefore in reference to it\nhe says, in the first [Epistle] to the Corinthians: “So also is the\nresurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it rises in\nincorruption.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4487\"\u003e4487\u003c/sup\u003e For he declares,\n“That which thou sowest cannot be quickened, unless first it\ndie.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4488\"\u003e4488\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.viii-p8\"\u003e2.

They do not take this fact into consideration, that there are\nthree things out of which, as I have shown, the complete man is composed\n—flesh, soul, and spirit. One of these does indeed preserve and\nfashion [the man]—this is the spirit; while as to another it is\nunited and formed—that is the flesh; then [comes] that which is\nbetween these two—that is the soul, which sometimes indeed, when\nit follows the spirit, is raised up by it, but sometimes it sympathizes\nwith the flesh, and falls into carnal lusts. Those then, as many as they\nbe, who have not that which saves and forms [us] into life [eternal],\nshall be, and shall be called, [mere] flesh and blood; for these are they\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_535.html\" id=\"ix.vii.x-Page_535\" n=\"535\" /\u003e\n\nwho have not the Spirit of God in themselves.

On the other hand, as many as fear God and trust in\nHis Son’s advent, and who through faith do establish the Spirit of\nGod in their hearts,—such men as these shall be properly called\nboth “pure,” and “spiritual,” and “those\nliving to God,” because they possess the Spirit of the Father, who\npurifies man, and raises him up to the life of God.

If, therefore,\nany one admix the ready inclination of the Spirit to be, as it were, a\nstimulus to the infirmity of the flesh, it inevitably follows that what\nis strong will prevail over the weak, so that the weakness of the flesh\nwill be absorbed by the strength of the Spirit; and that the man in whom\nthis takes place cannot in that case be carnal, but spiritual, because of\nthe fellowship of the Spirit. Thus it is, therefore, that the martyrs\nbear their witness, and despise death, not after the infirmity of the\nflesh, but because of the readiness of the Spirit. For when the infirmity\nof the flesh is absorbed, it exhibits the Spirit as powerful; and again,\nwhen the Spirit absorbs the weakness [of the flesh], it possesses the\nflesh as an inheritance in itself, and from both of these is formed a\nliving man,—living, indeed, because he partakes of the Spirit,\nbut man, because of the substance of flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.x-p6\"\u003e3. The flesh, therefore, when destitute of the Spirit\nof God, is dead, not having life, and cannot possess the kingdom of God:\n[it is as] irrational blood, like water poured out upon the ground. And\ntherefore he says, “As is the earthy, such are they that are\nearthy.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4509\"\u003e4509\u003c/sup\u003e But where the Spirit of\nthe Father is, there is a living man; [there is] the rational blood\npreserved by God for the avenging [of those that shed it]; [there is] the\nflesh possessed by the Spirit, forgetful indeed of what belongs to it,\nand adopting the quality of the Spirit, being made conformable to the\nWord of God. And on this account he (the apostle) declares, “As we\nhave borne the image of him who is of the earth, we shall also bear the\nimage of Him who is from heaven.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4510\"\u003e4510\u003c/sup\u003e What,\ntherefore, is the earthly? That which was fashioned. And what is the\nheavenly? The Spirit. As therefore he says, when we were destitute of the\ncelestial Spirit, we walked in former times in the oldness of the flesh,\nnot obeying God; so now let us, receiving the Spirit, walk in newness of\nlife, obeying God. Inasmuch, therefore, as without the Spirit of God we\ncannot be saved, the apostle exhorts us through faith and chaste\nconversation to preserve the Spirit of God, lest, having become\nnon-participators of the Divine Spirit, we lose the kingdom of heaven;\nand he exclaims, that flesh in itself, and blood, cannot possess the\nkingdom of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.x-p9\"\u003e4.

This is the reason for His\nwishing the temple (i.e., the flesh) to be clean, that the Spirit of God\nmay take delight therein, as a bridegroom with a bride. As, therefore,\nthe bride cannot [be said] to wed, but to be wedded, when the bridegroom\ncomes and takes her, so also the flesh cannot by itself possess the\nkingdom of God by inheritance; but it can be taken \u003ci\u003efor\u003c/i\u003e an\ninheritance into the kingdom of God. For a living person inherits the\ngoods of the deceased; and it is one thing to inherit, another to be\ninherited. The former rules, and exercises power over, and orders the\nthings inherited at his will; but the latter things are in a state of\nsubjection, are under order, and are ruled over by him who has obtained\nthe inheritance. What, therefore, is it that lives? The Spirit of God,\ndoubtless. What, again, are the possessions of the deceased? The various\nparts of the man, surely, which rot in the earth. But these are inherited\nby the Spirit when they are translated into the kingdom of heaven. For\nthis cause, too, did Christ die, that the Gospel covenant being\nmanifested and known to the whole world, might in the first place set\nfree His slaves; and then afterwards, as I have already shown, might\nconstitute them heirs of His property, when the Spirit possesses them by\ninheritance. For he who lives inherits, but the flesh is inherited. In\norder that we may not lose life by losing that Spirit which possesses us,\nthe apostle, exhorting us to the communion of the Spirit, has said,\naccording to reason, in those words already quoted, “That flesh and\nblood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” Just as if he were to\nsay, “Do not err; for unless the Word of God dwell with, and the\nSpirit of the Father be in you, and if ye shall live frivolously and\ncarelessly as if ye were this only, viz., mere flesh and blood, ye cannot\ninherit the kingdom of God.” an\ninheritance into the kingdom of God.

Admirably therefore does\nthe apostle exhibit our nature, and God’s universal appointment, in\nhis discourse about flesh and blood and the wild olive. For as the good\nolive, if neglected for a certain time, if left to grow wild and to run\nto wood, does itself become a wild olive; or again, if the wild olive be\ncarefully tended and grafted, it naturally reverts to its former\nfruit-bearing condition: so men also, when they become careless, and\nbring forth for fruit the lusts of the flesh like woody produce, are\nrendered, by their own fault, unfruitful in righteousness.

But as the engrafted wild olive does not certainly\nlose the substance of its wood, but changes the quality of its fruit, and\nreceives another name, being now not a wild olive, but a fruit-bearing\nolive, and is called so; so also, when man is grafted in by faith and\nreceives the Spirit of God, he certainly does not lose the substance of\nflesh, but changes the quality of the fruit [brought forth, i.e.,] of his\nworks, and receives another name,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4518\"\u003e4518\u003c/sup\u003e showing\nthat he has become changed for the better, being now not [mere] flesh and\nblood, but a spiritual man, and is called such. Then, again, as the wild olive, if it be\nnot grafted in, remains useless to its lord because of its woody quality,\nand is cut down as a tree bearing no fruit, and cast into the fire; so\nalso man, if he does not receive through faith the engrafting of the\nSpirit, remains in his old condition, and being [mere] flesh and blood,\nhe cannot inherit the kingdom of God.

And then,\nagain, he proceeds to tell us the spiritual actions which vivify a man,\nthat is, the engrafting of the Spirit; thus saying, “But the fruit\nof the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, benignity,\nfaith, meekness, continence, chastity: against these there is no\nlaw.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4528\"\u003e4528\u003c/sup\u003e As, therefore, he who has\ngone forward to the better things, and has brought forth the fruit of the\nSpirit, is saved altogether because of the communion of the Spirit; so\nalso he who has continued in the aforesaid works of the flesh, being\ntruly reckoned as carnal, because he did not receive the Spirit of God,\nshall not have power to inherit the kingdom of heaven. As, again, the\nsame apostle testifies, saying to the Corinthians, “Know ye not\nthat the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not\nerr,” he says: “neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor\nadulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor\nthieves, nor covetous, nor revilers, nor rapacious persons, shall inherit\nthe kingdom of God. And these ye indeed have been; but ye have been\nwashed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the\nname of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4529\"\u003e4529\u003c/sup\u003e He shows in the clearest manner\nthrough what things it is that man goes to destruction, if he has\ncontinued to live after the flesh; and then, on the other hand, [he\npoints out] through what things he is saved. Now he says that the things\nwhich save are the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our\nGod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xii-p6\"\u003e2. Since, therefore, in that passage he recounts those\nworks of the flesh which are without the Spirit, which bring death [upon\ntheir doers], he exclaimed at the end of his Epistle, in accordance with\nwhat he had already declared, “And as we have borne the image of\nhim who is of the earth, we shall also bear the image of Him who is from\nheaven. For this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the\nkingdom of God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4530\"\u003e4530\u003c/sup\u003e Now this which he\nsays, “as we have borne the image of him who is of the\nearth,” is analogous to what has been declared, “And such\nindeed ye were; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but\nye have been justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the\nSpirit of our God.” When, therefore, did we bear the image of him\nwho is of the earth? Doubtless it was when those actions spoken of as\n“works of the flesh” used to be wrought in us. And then,\nagain, when [do we bear] the image of the heavenly? Doubtless when he\nsays, “Ye have been washed,” believing in the name of the\nLord, and receiving His Spirit. Now we have washed away, not the\nsubstance of our body, nor the image of our [primary] formation, but the\nformer vain conversation. In these members, therefore, in which we were\ngoing to destruction by working the works of corruption, in these very\nmembers are we made alive by working the works of the Spirit.\u003c/p\u003e",

For as the flesh is capable of corruption, so\nis it also of incorruption; and as it is of death, so is it also of life.\nThese two do mutually give way to each other; and both cannot remain in\nthe same place, but one is driven out by the other, and the presence of\nthe one destroys that of the other. If, then, when death takes possession\nof a man, it drives life away from him, and proves him to be dead, much\nmore does life, when it has obtained power over the man, drive out death,\nand restore him as living unto God. For if death brings mortality, why\nshould not life, when it comes, vivify man? Just as Esaias the prophet\nsays, “Death devoured when it had prevailed.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4531\"\u003e4531\u003c/sup\u003e And again, “God has wiped away every\ntear from every face.” Thus that former life is expelled, because\nit was not given by the Spirit, but by the breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xiii-p3\"\u003e2. For the\nbreath of life, which also rendered man an animated being, is one thing,\nand the vivifying Spirit another, which also caused him to become\nspiritual. And for this reason Isaiah said, “Thus saith the \u003cspan class=\"sc\" id=\"ix.vii.xiii-p3.2\"\u003eLord\u003c/span\u003e, who made heaven and\nestablished it, who founded the earth and the things therein, and gave\nbreath to the people\n\n, who made heaven and\nestablished it, who founded the earth and the things therein, and gave\nbreath to the people\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_538.html\" id=\"ix.vii.xiii-Page_538\" n=\"538\" /\u003e\n\nupon it, and Spirit to those walking\nupon it;”\n\nupon it, and Spirit to those walking\nupon it;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4532\"\u003e4532\u003c/sup\u003e thus telling us that\nbreath is indeed given in common to all people upon earth, but that the\nSpirit is theirs alone who tread down earthly desires. And therefore\nIsaiah himself, distinguishing the things already mentioned, again\nexclaims, “For the Spirit shall go forth from Me, and I have made\nevery breath.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4533\"\u003e4533\u003c/sup\u003e Thus does he attribute\nthe Spirit as peculiar to God which in the last times He pours forth upon\nthe human race by the adoption of sons; but [he shows] that breath was\ncommon throughout the creation, and points it out as something created.\nNow what has been made is a different thing from him who makes it. The\nbreath, then, is temporal, but the Spirit eternal. The breath, too,\nincreases [in strength] for a short period, and continues for a certain\ntime; after that it takes its departure, leaving its former abode\ndestitute of breath. But when the Spirit pervades the man within and\nwithout, inasmuch as it continues there, it never leaves him. “But\nthat is not first which is spiritual,” says the apostle, speaking\nthis as if with reference to us human beings; “but that is first\nwhich is animal, afterwards that which is spiritual,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4534\"\u003e4534\u003c/sup\u003e in accordance with reason. For there had been\na necessity that, in the first place, a human being should be fashioned,\nand that what was fashioned should receive the soul; afterwards that it\nshould thus receive the communion of the Spirit. Wherefore also\n“the first Adam was made” by the Lord “a living soul,\nthe second Adam a quickening spirit.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4535\"\u003e4535\u003c/sup\u003e As, then, he who was made a living soul forfeited life when he\nturned aside to what was evil, so, on the other hand, the same\nindividual, when he reverts to what is good, and receives the quickening\nSpirit, shall find life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xiii-p8\"\u003e3. For it is not one thing which dies and another\nwhich is quickened, as neither is it one thing which is lost and another\nwhich is found, but the Lord came seeking for that same sheep which had\nbeen lost. What was it, then, which was dead? Undoubtedly it was the\nsubstance of the flesh; the same, too, which had lost the breath of life,\nand had become breathless and dead. This same, therefore, was what the\nLord came to quicken, that as in Adam we do all die, as being of an\nanimal nature, in Christ we may all live, as being spiritual, not laying\naside God’s handiwork, but the lusts of the flesh, and receiving\nthe Holy Spirit; as the apostle says in the Epistle to the Colossians:\n“Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth.”\nAnd what these are he himself explains: “Fornication, uncleanness,\ninordinate affection, evil concupiscence; and covetousness, which is\nidolatry.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4536\"\u003e4536\u003c/sup\u003e The laying aside of these\nis what the apostle preaches; and he declares that those who do such\nthings, as being merely flesh and blood, cannot inherit the kingdom of\nheaven. For their soul, tending towards what is worse, and descending to\nearthly lusts, has become a partaker in the same designation which\nbelongs to these [lusts, viz., “earthly”], which, when the\napostle commands us to lay aside, he says in the same Epistle,\n“Cast ye off the old man with his deeds.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4537\"\u003e4537\u003c/sup\u003e But when he said this, he does not remove away the ancient\nformation [of man]; for in that case it would be incumbent on us to rid\nourselves of its company by committing suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xiii-p11\"\u003e4. But the apostle himself also, being one who had been\nformed in a womb, and had issued thence, wrote to us, and confessed in\nhis Epistle to the Philippians that “to live in the flesh was the\nfruit of [his] work;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4538\"\u003e4538\u003c/sup\u003e thus\nexpressing himself. Now the final result of the work of the Spirit is the\nsalvation of the flesh.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4539\"\u003e4539\u003c/sup\u003e For what other visible fruit is there of the invisible Spirit,\nthan the rendering of the flesh mature and capable of incorruption? If\nthen [he says], “To live in the flesh, this is the result of labour\nto me,” he did not surely contemn the substance of flesh in that\npassage where he said, “Put ye off the old man with his\nworks;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4540\"\u003e4540\u003c/sup\u003e but he points out that we\nshould lay aside our former conversation, that which waxes old and\nbecomes corrupt; and for this reason he goes on to say, “And put ye\non the new man, that which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of\nHim who created him.” In this, therefore, that he says,\n“which is renewed in knowledge,” he demonstrates that he, the\nselfsame man who was in ignorance in times past, that is, in ignorance of\nGod, is renewed by that knowledge which has respect to Him. For the\nknowledge of God renews man. And when he says, “after the image of\nthe Creator,” he sets forth the recapitulation of the same man, who\nwas at the beginning made after the likeness of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xiii-p15\"\u003e5. And that he, the apostle, was the very same person\nwho had been born from the womb, that is, of the ancient substance of\nflesh, he does himself declare in the Epistle to the Galatians:\n“But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s\nwomb, and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might\npreach Him among the Gentiles,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4541\"\u003e4541\u003c/sup\u003e it was\nnot, as I have already observed, one person who had\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_539.html\" id=\"ix.vii.xiii-Page_539\" n=\"539\" /\u003e\n\nbeen\nborn from the womb, and another who preached the Gospel of the Son of\nGod; but that same individual who formerly was ignorant, and used to\npersecute the Church, when the revelation was made to him from heaven,\nand the Lord conferred with him, as I have pointed out in the third\nbook,\n\nbeen\nborn from the womb, and another who preached the Gospel of the Son of\nGod; but that same individual who formerly was ignorant, and used to\npersecute the Church, when the revelation was made to him from heaven,\nand the Lord conferred with him, as I have pointed out in the third\nbook,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4542\"\u003e4542\u003c/sup\u003e preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God, who\nwas crucified under Pontius Pilate, his former ignorance being driven out\nby his subsequent knowledge: just as the blind men whom the Lord healed\ndid certainly lose their blindness, but received the substance of their\neyes perfect, and obtained the power of vision in the very same eyes with\nwhich they formerly did not see; the darkness being merely driven away by\nthe power of vision, while the substance of the eyes was retained, in\norder that, by means of those eyes through which they had not seen,\nexercising again the visual power, they might give thanks to Him who had\nrestored them again to sight. And thus, also, he whose withered hand was\nhealed, and all who were healed generally, did not change those parts of\ntheir bodies which had at their birth come forth from the womb, but\nsimply obtained these anew in a healthy condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xiii-p18\"\u003e6. For the Maker of all things, the Word of God, who\ndid also from the beginning form man, when He found His handiwork\nimpaired by wickedness, performed upon it all kinds of healing. At one\ntime [He did so], as regards each separate member, as it is found in His\nown handiwork; and at another time He did once for all restore man sound\nand whole in all points, preparing him perfect for Himself unto the\nresurrection. For what was His object in healing [different] portions of\nthe flesh, and restoring them to their original condition, if those parts\nwhich had been healed by Him were not in a position to obtain salvation?\nFor if it was [merely] a temporary benefit which He conferred, He granted\nnothing of importance to those who were the subjects of His healing. Or\nhow can they maintain that the flesh is incapable of receiving the life\nwhich flows from Him, when it received healing from Him? For life is\nbrought about through healing, and incorruption through life. He,\ntherefore, who confers healing, the same does also confer life; and He\n[who gives] life, also surrounds His own handiwork with incorruption.\u003c/p\u003e",

For thus they will allege that this passage refers\nto the flesh strictly so called, and not to fleshly works, as I have\npointed out, so representing the apostle as contradicting himself. For\nimmediately following, in the same Epistle, he says conclusively,\nspeaking thus in reference to the flesh: “For this corruptible must\nput on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So, when\nthis mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass\nthe saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,\nwhere is thy sting? O death, where is thy victory?”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4549\"\u003e4549\u003c/sup\u003e Now these words shall be appropriately said at\nthe time when this mortal and corruptible flesh, which is subject to\ndeath, which also is pressed down by a certain dominion of death, rising\nup into life, shall put on incorruption and immortality. For then,\nindeed, shall death be truly vanquished, when that flesh which is held\ndown by it shall go forth from under its dominion. And again, to the\nPhilippians he says: “But our conversation is in heaven, from\nwhence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who shall\ntransfigure the body of our humiliation conformable to the body of His\nglory, even as He is able (\u003ci\u003eita ut possit\u003c/i\u003e) according to the working\nof His own power.”) according to the working\nof His own power.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4550\"\u003e4550\u003c/sup\u003e What, then, is this\n“body of humiliation” which the Lord shall transfigure, [so\nas to be] conformed to “the body of His glory?” Plainly it is\nthis body composed of flesh, which is indeed humbled when it falls into\nthe earth. Now its transformation [takes place thus], that while it is\nmortal and corruptible, it becomes immortal and incorruptible, not after\nits own proper substance, but after the mighty working of the Lord, who\nis able to invest the mortal with immortality, and the corruptible with\nincorruption. And therefore he says,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4551\"\u003e4551\u003c/sup\u003e “that\nmortality may be swallowed up of life.

Now, what is mortal shall be swallowed up of life, when\nthe flesh is dead no longer, but remains living and incorruptible,\nhymning the praises of God, who has perfected us for this very thing. In\norder, therefore, that we may be perfected for this, aptly does he say to\nthe Corinthians, “Glorify God in your body.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4553\"\u003e4553\u003c/sup\u003e Now God is He who gives rise to immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xiv-p15\"\u003e4. That he uses these words with respect to the body of\nflesh, and to none other, he declares to the Corinthians manifestly,\nindubitably, and free from all ambiguity: “Always bearing about in\nour body the dying of Jesus,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4554\"\u003e4554\u003c/sup\u003e that also the life of Jesus Christ\nmight be manifested in our body.

And inasmuch as the apostle has\nnot pronounced against the very substance of flesh and blood, that it\ncannot inherit the kingdom of God, the same apostle has everywhere\nadopted the term “flesh and blood” with regard to the Lord\nJesus Christ, partly indeed to establish His human nature (for He did\nHimself speak of Himself as the Son of man), and partly that He might\nconfirm the salvation of our flesh. For if the flesh were not in a\nposition to be saved, the Word of God would in no wise have become flesh.\nAnd if the blood of the righteous were not to be inquired after, the Lord\nwould certainly not have had blood [in His composition]. But inasmuch as\nblood cries out (\u003ci\u003evocalis est\u003c/i\u003e) from the beginning [of the world],\nGod said to Cain, when he had slain his brother, “The voice of thy\nbrother’s blood crieth to Me.”) from the beginning [of the world],\nGod said to Cain, when he had slain his brother, “The voice of thy\nbrother’s blood crieth to Me.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4563\"\u003e4563\u003c/sup\u003e And as their blood will be inquired after, He said to those with\nNoah, “For your blood of your souls will I require, [even] from the\nhand of all beasts;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4564\"\u003e4564\u003c/sup\u003e and\nagain, “Whosoever will shed man’s blood,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4565\"\u003e4565\u003c/sup\u003e it shall be shed for his\nblood.” In like manner, too, did the Lord say to those who should\nafterwards shed His blood, “All righteous blood shall be required\nwhich is shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the\nblood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple\nand the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon\nthis generation.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4566\"\u003e4566\u003c/sup\u003e He thus points out the recapitulation that\nshould take place in his own person of the effusion of blood from the\nbeginning, of all the righteous men and of the prophets, and that by\nmeans of Himself there should be a requisition of their blood. Now this\n[blood] could not be required unless it also had the capability of being\nsaved; nor would the Lord have summed up these things in Himself, unless\nHe had Himself been made flesh and blood after the way of the original\nformation [of man], saving in his own person at the end that which had in\nthe beginning perished in Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xv-p6\"\u003e2. But if the Lord became incarnate for any other order\nof things, and took flesh of any other substance, He has not then summed\nup human nature in His own person, nor in that case can He be termed\nflesh. For flesh has been truly made [to consist in] a transmission of\nthat thing moulded originally from the dust. But if it had been necessary\nfor Him to draw the material [of His body] from another substance, the\nFather would at the beginning have moulded the material [of flesh] from a\ndifferent substance [than from what He actually did]. But now the case\nstands thus, that the Word has saved that which really was [created,\nviz.,] humanity which had perished, effecting by means of Himself that\ncommunion which should be held with it, and seeking out its salvation.\nBut the thing which had perished possessed flesh and blood. For the Lord,\ntaking dust from the earth, moulded man; and it was upon his behalf that\nall the dispensation of the Lord’s advent took place. He had\nHimself, therefore, flesh and blood, recapitulating in Himself not a\ncertain other, but that original handiwork of the Father, seeking out\nthat thing which had perished. And for this cause the apostle, in the\nEpistle to the Colossians, says, “And though ye were formerly\nalienated, and enemies to His knowledge by evil works, yet now ye have\nbeen reconciled in the body of His flesh, through His death, to present\nyourselves holy and chaste, and without fault in His sight.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4567\"\u003e4567\u003c/sup\u003e He says, “Ye have been reconciled\nin the body of His flesh,” because the righteous flesh has\nreconciled that flesh which was being kept under bondage in sin, and\nbrought it into friendship with God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xv-p8\"\u003e3.

Now, if the Lord had taken\nflesh from another substance, He would not, by so doing, have reconciled\nthat one to God which had become inimical through transgression. But now,\nby means of communion with Himself, the Lord has reconciled man to God\nthe Father, in reconciling us to Himself by the body of His own flesh,\nand redeeming us by His own blood, as the apostle says to the Ephesians,\n“In whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of\nsins;”\n\nwas deceit found in His soul, while we,\non the other hand, are sinners, he says what is the fact.

And therefore, when His disciples asked Him for what cause\nthe man had been born blind, whether for his own or his parents’\nfault, He replied, “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents,\nbut that the works of God should be made manifest in him.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4581\"\u003e4581\u003c/sup\u003e Now the work of God is the fashioning of man.\nFor, as the Scripture says, He made [man] by a kind of process:\n“And the Lord took clay from the earth, and formed man.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4582\"\u003e4582\u003c/sup\u003e Wherefore also the Lord spat on the ground and\nmade clay, and smeared it upon the eyes, pointing out the original\nfashioning [of man], how it was effected, and manifesting the hand of God\nto those who can understand by what [hand] man was formed out of the\ndust. For that which the artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the\nwomb, [viz., the blind man’s eyes], He then supplied in public,\nthat the works of God might be manifested in him, in order that we might\nnot be seeking out another hand by which man was fashioned, nor another\nFather; knowing that this hand of God which formed us at the beginning,\nand which does form us in the womb, has in the last times sought us out\nwho were lost, winning back His own, and taking up the lost sheep upon\nHis shoulders, and with joy restoring it to the fold of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xvi-p11\"\u003e3. Now, that the Word of God forms us in the womb, He\nsays to Jeremiah, “Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee;\nand before thou wentest forth from the belly, I sanctified thee, and\nappointed thee a prophet among the nations.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4583\"\u003e4583\u003c/sup\u003e And Paul, too, says in like manner, “But when it pleased\nGod, who separated me from my mother’s womb, that I might declare\nHim among the nations.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4584\"\u003e4584\u003c/sup\u003e As,\ntherefore, we are by the Word formed in the womb, this very same Word\nformed the visual power in him who had been blind from his birth; showing\nopenly who it is that fashions us in secret, since the Word Himself had\nbeen made manifest to men: and declaring the original formation of Adam,\nand the manner in which he was created, and by what hand he was\nfashioned, indicating the whole from a part. For the Lord who formed the\nvisual powers is He who made the whole man, carrying out the will of the\nFather. And inasmuch as man, with respect to that formation which, was\nafter Adam, having fallen into transgression, needed the laver of\nregeneration, [the Lord] said to him [upon whom He had conferred sight],\nafter He had smeared his eyes with the clay, “Go to Siloam, and\nwash;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4585\"\u003e4585\u003c/sup\u003e thus restoring to him both\n[his perfect] confirmation, and that regeneration which takes place by\nmeans of the laver. And for this reason when he was washed he came\nseeing, that he might both know Him who had fashioned him, and that man\nmight learn [to know] Him who has conferred upon him life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xvi-p15\"\u003e4. All the followers of Valentinus, therefore, lose\ntheir case, when they say that man was not fashioned out of this earth,\nbut from a fluid and diffused substance. For, from the earth out of which\nthe Lord formed eyes for that man, from the same earth it is evident that\nman was also fashioned at the beginning. For it were incompatible that\nthe eyes should indeed be formed from one source and the rest of the body\nfrom another; as neither would it be compatible that one [being]\nfashioned the body, and another the eyes. But He, the very same who\nformed Adam at the beginning, with whom also the Father spake, [saying],\n“Let Us make man after Our image and likeness,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4586\"\u003e4586\u003c/sup\u003e revealing Himself in these last times to men,\nformed visual organs (\u003ci\u003evisionem\u003c/i\u003e) for him who had been blind [in\n\n) for him who had been blind [in\n\n\u003cpb href=\"/ccel/schaff/anf01/Page_544.html\" id=\"ix.vii.xvi-Page_544\" n=\"544\" /\u003e\n\nthat body which he had derived] from Adam.

For indeed the creation could not have\nsustained Him [on the cross], if He had sent forth [simply by commission]\nwhat was the fruit of ignorance and defect. Now we have repeatedly shown\nthat the incarnate Word of God was suspended upon a tree, and even the\nvery heretics do acknowledge that He was crucified. How, then, could the\nfruit of ignorance and defect sustain Him who contains the knowledge of\nall things, and is true and perfect? Or how could that creation which was\nconcealed from the Father, and far removed from Him, have sustained His\nWord? And if this world were made by the angels (it matters not whether\nwe suppose their ignorance or their cognizance of the Supreme God), when\nthe Lord declared, “For I am in the Father, and the Father in\nMe,”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4604\"\u003e4604\u003c/sup\u003e how could this workmanship\nof the angels have borne to be burdened at once with the Father and the\nSon? How, again, could that creation which is beyond the Pleroma have\ncontained Him who contains the entire Pleroma? Inasmuch, then, as all\nthese things are impossible and incapable of proof, that preaching of the\nChurch is alone true [which proclaims] that His own creation bare Him,\nwhich subsists by the power, the skill, and the wisdom of God; which is\nsustained, indeed, after an invisible manner by the Father, but, on the\ncontrary, after a visible manner it bore His Word: and this is the true\n[Word].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xix-p3\"\u003e2.

And thus one God the Father is declared, who is above\nall, and through all, and in all. The Father is indeed above all, and He\nis the Head of Christ; but the Word is through all things, and is Himself\nthe Head of the Church; while the Spirit is in us all, and He is the\nliving water,\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4607\"\u003e4607\u003c/sup\u003e which the Lord grants to\nthose who rightly believe in Him, and love Him, and who know that\n“there is one Father, who is above all, and through all, and in us\nall.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4608\"\u003e4608\u003c/sup\u003e And to these things does\nJohn also, the disciple of the Lord, bear witness, when he speaks thus in\nthe Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\nGod, and the Word was God.

To His own things He came, and His own people received Him\nnot.

For along with the fruit they did also\nfall under the power of death, because they did eat in disobedience; and\ndisobedience to God entails death.

For it is said,\n“There was made in the evening, and there was made in the morning,\none day.” Now in this same day that they did eat, in that also did\nthey die. But according to the cycle and progress of the days, after\nwhich one is termed first, another second, and another third, if anybody\nseeks diligently to learn upon what day out of the seven it was that Adam\ndied, he will find it by examining the dispensation of the Lord. For by\nsumming up in Himself the whole human race from the beginning to the end,\nHe has also summed up its death. From this it is clear that the Lord\nsuffered death, in obedience to His Father, upon that day on which Adam\ndied while he disobeyed God. Now he died on the same day in which he did\neat.

For he\n(Antichrist) being endued with all the power of the devil, shall come,\nnot as a righteous king, nor as a legitimate king, [i.e., one] in\nsubjection to God, but an impious, unjust, and lawless one; as an\napostate, iniquitous and murderous; as a robber, concentrating in himself\n[all] satanic apostasy, and setting aside idols to persuade [men] that he\nhimself is God, raising up himself as the only idol, having in himself\nthe multifarious errors of the other idols. This he does, in order that\nthey who do [now] worship the devil by means of many abominations, may\nserve himself by this one idol, of whom the apostle thus speaks in the\nsecond Epistle to the Thessalonians: “Unless there shall come a\nfailing away first, and the man of sin shall be revealed, the son of\nperdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called\nGod, or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God,\nshowing himself as if he were God.” The apostle therefore clearly\npoints out his apostasy, and that he is lifted up above all that is\ncalled God, or that is worshipped—that is, above every idol\n—for these are indeed so called by men, but are not [really] gods;\nand that he will endeavour in a tyrannical manner to set himself forth as\nGod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xxvi-p2\"\u003e2. Moreover, he (the apostle) has also pointed out this\nwhich I have shown in many ways, that the temple in Jerusalem was made by\nthe direction of the true God. For the apostle himself, speaking in his\nown person, distinctly called it the temple of God. Now I have shown in\nthe third book, that no one is termed God by the apostles when speaking\nfor themselves, except Him who truly is God, the Father of our Lord, by\nwhose directions the temple which is at Jerusalem was constructed for\nthose purposes which I have already mentioned; in which [temple] the\nenemy shall sit, endeavouring to show himself as Christ, as the Lord also\ndeclares: “But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation,\nwhich has been spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy\nplace (let him that readeth understand), then let those who are in Judea\nflee into the mountains; and he who is upon the house-top, let him not\ncome down to take anything out of his house: for there shall then be\ngreat hardship, such as has not been from the beginning of the world\nuntil now, nor ever shall be.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4664\"\u003e4664\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xxvi-p4\"\u003e3.

He says: “And, behold,\neyes were in this horn as the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great\nthings, and his look was more stout than his fellows.

Those nations, \nhowever, who did not of themselves raise up their eyes unto heaven, nor\nreturned thanks to their Maker, nor wished to behold the light of truth,\nbut who were like blind mice concealed in the depths of ignorance, the\nword justly reckons “as waste water from a sink, and as the\nturning-weight of a balance—in fact, as nothing;”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4698\"\u003e4698\u003c/sup\u003e so far useful and serviceable to the just, as\nstubble conduces towards the growth of the wheat, and its straw, by means\nof combustion, serves for working gold.

And there is therefore in this beast, when he comes,\na recapitulation made of all sorts of iniquity and of every deceit, in\norder that all apostate power, flowing into and being shut up in him, may\nbe sent into the furnace of fire. Fittingly, therefore, shall his name\npossess the number six hundred and sixty-six, since he sums up in his own\nperson all the commixture of wickedness which took place previous to the\ndeluge, due to the apostasy of the angels. For Noah was six hundred years\nold when the deluge came upon the earth, sweeping away the rebellious\nworld, for the sake of that most infamous generation which lived in the\ntimes of Noah. And [Antichrist] also sums up every error of devised idols\nsince the flood, together with the slaying of the prophets and the\ncutting off of the just. For that image which was set up by\nNebuchadnezzar had indeed a height of sixty cubits, while the breadth was\nsix cubits; on account of which Ananias, Azarias, and Mishaell, when they\ndid not worship it, were cast into a furnace of fire, pointing out\nprophetically, by what happened to them, the wrath against the righteous\nwhich shall arise towards the [time of the] end. For that image, taken as\na whole, was a prefiguring of this man’s coming, decreeing that he\nshould undoubtedly himself alone be worshipped by all men. Thus, then,\nthe six hundred years of Noah, in whose time the deluge occurred because\nof the apostasy, and the number of the cubits of the image for which\nthese just men were sent into the fiery furnace, do indicate the number\nof the name of that man in whom is concentrated the whole apostasy of six\nthousand years, and unrighteousness, and wickedness, and false prophecy,\nand deception; for which things’ sake a cataclysm of fire shall\nalso come [upon the earth].\u003c/p\u003e",

But, knowing the sure number\ndeclared by Scripture, that is, six hundred sixty and six, let them\nawait, in the first place, the division of the kingdom into ten; then, in\nthe next place, when these kings are reigning, and beginning to set their\naffairs in order, and advance their kingdom, [let them learn] to\nacknowledge that he who shall come claiming the kingdom for himself, and\nshall terrify those men of whom we have been speaking, having a name\ncontaining the aforesaid number, is truly the abomination of desolation.\nThis, too, the apostle affirms: “When they shall say, Peace and\nsafety, then sudden destruction shall come upon them.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4703\"\u003e4703\u003c/sup\u003e And Jeremiah does not merely point out his\nsudden coming, but he even indicates the tribe from which he shall come,\nwhere he says, “We shall hear the voice of his swift horses from\nDan; the whole earth shall be moved by the voice of the neighing of his\ngalloping horses: he shall also come and devour the earth, and the\nfulness thereof, the city also, and they that dwell therein.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4704\"\u003e4704\u003c/sup\u003e This, too, is the reason that this tribe is\nnot reckoned in the Apocalypse along with those which are saved.\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4705\"\u003e4705\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xxxi-p9\"\u003e3.

Inasmuch, therefore, as the opinions of certain\n[orthodox persons] are derived from heretical discourses, they are both\nignorant of God’s dispensations, and of the mystery of the\nresurrection of the just, and of the [earthly] kingdom which is the\ncommencement of incorruption, by means of which kingdom those who shall\nbe worthy are accustomed gradually to partake of the divine nature\n(\u003ci\u003ecapere Deum\u003c/i\u003e\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4720\"\u003e4720\u003c/sup\u003e); and it is\nnecessary to tell them respecting those things, that it behoves the\nrighteous first to receive the promise of the inheritance which God\npromised to the fathers, and to reign in it, when they rise again to\nbehold God in this creation which is renovated, and that the judgment\nshould take place afterwards. For\nit is just that in that very creation in which they toiled or were\nafflicted, being proved in every way by suffering, they should receive\nthe reward of their suffering; and that in the creation in which they\nwere slain because of their love to God, in that they should be revived\nagain; and that in the creation in which they endured servitude, in that\nthey should reign. For God is rich in all things, and all things are His.\nIt is fitting, therefore, that the creation itself, being restored to its\nprimeval condition, should without restraint be under the dominion of the\nrighteous; and the apostle has made this plain in the Epistle to the\nRomans, when he thus speaks: “For the expectation of the creature\nwaiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature has\nbeen subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath\nsubjected the same in hope; since the creature itself shall also be\ndelivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the\nsons of God.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4721\"\u003e4721\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.vii.xxxiii-p4\"\u003e2.

For his seed is the Church,\nwhich receives the adoption to God through the Lord, as John the Baptist\nsaid: “For God is able from the stones to raise up children to\nAbraham.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4727\"\u003e4727\u003c/sup\u003e Thus also the apostle says\nin the Epistle to the Galatians: “But ye, brethren, as Isaac was,\nare the children of the promise.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4728\"\u003e4728\u003c/sup\u003e And again,\nin the same Epistle, he plainly declares that they who have believed in\nChrist do receive Christ, the promise to Abraham thus saying, “The\npromises were spoken to Abraham, and to his seed.

For I have a more vivid\nrecollection of what occurred at that time than of recent events\n(inasmuch as the experiences of childhood, keeping pace with the growth\nof the soul, become incorporated with it); so that I can even describe\nthe place where the blessed Polycarp used to sit and discourse—\nhis going out, too, and his coming in—his general mode of life\nand personal appearance, together with the discourses which he delivered\nto the people; also how he would speak of his familiar intercourse with\nJohn, and with the rest of those who had seen the Lord; and how he would\ncall their words to remembrance. Whatsoever things he had heard from them\nrespecting the Lord, both with regard to His miracles and His teaching,\nPolycarp having thus received [information] from the eye-witnesses of the\nWord of life, would recount them all in harmony with the Scriptures.\nThese things, through, God’s mercy which was upon me, I then\nlistened to attentively, and treasured them up not on paper, but in my\nheart; and I am continually, by God’s grace, revolving these things\naccurately in my mind. And I can bear witness before God, that if that\nblessed and apostolical presbyter had heard any such thing, he would have\ncried out, and stopped his ears, exclaiming as he was wont to do:\n“O good God, for what times hast Thou reserved me, that I should\nendure these things?” And he would have fled from the very spot\nwhere, sitting or standing, he had heard such words. This fact, too, can\nbe made clear, from his Epistles which he despatched, whether to the\nneighbouring Churches to confirm them, or to certain of the brethren,\nadmonishing and exhorting them.\u003c/p\u003e",

And he did not\nneglect to do so, but at once poured forth his supplication.

Behold that [city] Babylon, haughty in the flower and pride of\nimpiousness, and its inhabitants completely given over to sin of every\ndescription. But he, emerging from the depth, spat out the brine of sins,\nand rejoiced to plunge into the sweet waters of piety. And now, in like\nmanner, with regard to that mother of Zebedee’s children, do not\nadmire merely what she said, but also the time at which she uttered these\nwords. For when was it that she drew near to the Redeemer? Not after the\nresurrection, nor after the preaching of His name, nor after the\nestablishment of His kingdom; but it was when the Lord said,\n“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be\ndelivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall kill Him,\nand on the third day He shall rise again.”\u003csup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-note-id=\"4918\"\u003e4918\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.viii.lv-p10\"\u003eThese things the Saviour told in reference to His\nsufferings and cross; to these persons He predicted His passion. Nor did\nHe conceal the fact that it should be of a most ignominious kind, at the\nhands of the chief priests. This woman, however, had attached another\nmeaning to the dispensation of His sufferings. The Saviour was\nforetelling death; and she asked for the glory of immortality. The Lord\nwas asserting that He must stand arraigned before impious judges; but\nshe, taking no note of that judgment, requested as of the judge:\n“Grant,” she said, “that these my two sons may sit, one\non the right hand, and the other on the left, in Thy glory.” In the\none case the passion is referred to, in the other the kingdom is\nunderstood. The Saviour was speaking of the cross, while she had in view\nthe glory which admits no suffering. This woman, therefore, as I have\nalready said, is worthy of our admiration, not merely for what she\nsought, but also for the occasion of her making the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ix.viii.lv-p11\"\u003eShe did indeed suffer, not merely as a pious person,\nbut also as a woman. For, having been instructed by His words, she\nconsidered and believed that it would come to pass, that the kingdom of\nChrist should flourish in glory, and walk in its vastness throughout the\nworld, and be increased by the preaching of piety. She understood, as was\n[in fact] the case, that He who appeared in a lowly guise had delivered\nand received every promise. I will inquire upon another occasion, when I\ncome to treat upon this humility, whether the Lord rejected her petition\nconcerning His kingdom. But she thought that the same confidence would\nnot be possessed by her, when, at the appearance of the angels, He should\nbe ministered to by the angels, and receive service from the entire\nheavenly host. Taking the Saviour, therefore, apart in a retired place,\nshe earnestly desired of Him those things which transcend every human\nnature.\u003c/p\u003e",
