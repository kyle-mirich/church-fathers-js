His death, in extreme old age under the first of\nthe Antonines, has been variously dated; but we may accept the date we\nhave given, as rendered probable by that of the Paschal question, which\nhe so lovingly settled with Anicetus, Bishop of Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iv.i-p3\"\u003eThe Epistle to the Philippians is the more interesting\nas denoting the state of that beloved church, the firstborn of European\nchurches, and so greatly endeared to St. Paul. It abounds in practical\nwisdom, and is rich in Scripture and Scriptural allusions. It reflects\nthe spirit of St. John, alike in its lamb-like and its aquiline features:\nhe is as loving as the beloved disciple himself when he speaks of Christ\nand his church, but “the son of thunder” is echoed in his\nrebukes of threatened corruptions in faith and morals. Nothing can be\nmore clear than his view of the doctrines of grace; but he writes like\nthe disciple of St. John, though in perfect harmony with St. Paul’s\nhymn-like eulogy of Christian love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iv.i-p4\"\u003eThe following is the original \u003cspan class=\"sc\" id=\"iv.i-p4.1\"\u003eIntroductory Notice\u003c/span\u003e:—:—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iv.i-p5\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sc\" id=\"iv.i-p5.1\"\u003eThe\n\u003c/span\u003eauthenticity of the following Epistle can on no fair grounds be\nquestioned.
